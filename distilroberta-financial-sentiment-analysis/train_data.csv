EQUITY Factsheet_ A.P. Moller - Maersk A_S,"Highlights
uMaersk’s Q2 2023 EBITDA of USD2.9 billion (-
72% Y/Y; -27% Q/Q) was 16% above consensus 
estimate, attributed to good cost management 
instead of strong rates, in our view. The fall in 
earnings was mainly caused by Ocean (-76% Y/
Y; -33% Q/Q) on reduced freight rates (-51% Y/
Y; -15% Q/Q) and weaker volumes (-6% Y/Y; 
+7% Q/Q). 
uMaersk lifted the bottom end of its 2023 EBITDA 
guidance to USD9.5-USD11.0 billion from 
USD8.0-11.0 billion reflecting the stronger H1 
2023 results but lowered its 2023 market 
volume outlook to -4.0% to -1.0% (previously -
2.5% to +0.5%) on continued inventory 
correction till the end of 2023. We think the 
implied sequential drop in H1 2023 earnings 
reflects the ongoing decline in Maersk’s 
contracted rate given that they are being reset 
to a level nearer to the spot which has fallen 
sharply since mid-2022. Also, we gathered that 
the industry’s supply of new vessels may 
increase freight capacity by 9% and 10% in 
2023 and 2024 respectively, which we think will 
outgrow demand causing overcapacity and 
further deterioration in freight rates.
uWe forecast EPS of USD220 for 2023 and 
USD100 for 2024 as we expect a further 
weakness in freight rates.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uOur call is 2-STARS (Sell). We believe Maersk’s 
near-term financial performance will be 
vulnerable to lower freight rates, which have 
been on a downward trend due to continuing 
subdued demand and easing of port congestion 
which release capacity back into service. 
Furthermore, we think the negative feedback 
loop to freight rates will continue and think its 
customers may seek renegotiation given the 
price differential between contract and spot has 
widened. Also, the overhang situation may be 
amplified by the entry of new vessels which are 
projected to increase the industry’s supply by 9 
and 10% in 2023 and 2024 respectively. 
Nonetheless, we are positive about its long-
term strategy of growing its non-ocean logistic 
business to complement its core business with 
end-to-end solutions. 
uUpside risks include strong economic growth, 
which improves shipping activities, a positive 
reversal in freight rates, and effective cost 
management. 
uOur 12-month target price for Maersk of 
DKK9,500 reflects a 3.0x 2024 EV/EBITDA, 
broadly in line with peer average.","Industry Outlook
We maintain our sector recommendation for EMEA 
Industrial sector at neutral for Q4 2023 and 2024. 
We believe that the key issue facing the sector is 
the surge in energy price arising from the concern 
on potential supply disruption from the Middle 
East. However, supply chain disruptions have 
eased. This could be attributed to slower demand 
for goods and weak economy growth in China. In 
the past 12 months, the Shanghai Containerized 
Freight Index (SCFI) has declined about 30% to 
about $900 per TEU. This is a signal of weak 
demand on global movement of cargoes. 
Year to date as of October 16, 2023, the EMEA 
Industrial Index is up 13.0% versus the S&P 
Europe 350 Index increase of 10.0%. However, in 
Q3 2023, the EMEA Industrial sector’s 
performance was at -3.8%, which is below S&P 
Europe 350’s -1.8%.
The eurozone’s annual inflation rate dropped to 
4.3% in September (from August’s 5.2%). We 
expect lower inflation impact to be positive to 
industrial sector earnings as it lowers cost and 
widens operating margin. In Q4 2023, industrial 
players will likely focus on revenue growth via 
business volume increase instead of average 
selling price increases. For Q4 2023, the outlook 
should turn more positive as inflation moderates, 
although this is partially caused by a high base 
case comparison in Q4 2022. However, the growth 
momentum is likely to be slow as the factor of 
China reopening has so far generated little 
demand growth. In our view, industrial players will 
shift their focus to grow volume instead of passing 
on increases in cost as inflation cools down. 
The Eurozone Manufacturing PMI for September 
stands at 43.4, which is little changed compared 
to the August level of 43.5. According to our 
findings, contractions in order book and an output 
decline trend is still ongoing. On the positive side, 
the price of input material has declined and 
manufacturers are passing the cost savings to 
their clients.
Due to the aircraft engine recall issues (PW1100G 
Geared Turbofan Engines), we are now neutral on 
Aerospace & Defense from positive previously. We also lowered our opinion to neutral for Airlines. 
Although airlines players will likely benefit from 
the global aviation sector recovery due to 
Covid-19 normalization, its margin could be 
affected by the spike in jet fuel price (in line 
with the higher crude oil price). 
We are positive on the Industrial Machinery and 
Industrial Conglomerates sub-sectors. 
Industrial Machinery sub-sector players are the 
beneficiaries of high demand due to energy 
efficiency and automation. For Industrial 
Conglomerates, strong demand for 
electrification and sustainability services 
should continue to support revenue growth.
The focus for Trading Companies and 
Distributors will be to reduce the record-high 
inventory in the near term, in our view. This 
may affect their near-term margin, although it 
could lead to stronger cash flow. For the Heavy 
Electrical Equipment sub-sector, the smoother 
supply chain should lead to improvement in 
revenue recognition. However, the intense 
competition should keep the margin upside 
limited.
We are less positive on the Building Products 
and Construction Machinery & Heavy Trucks 
sub-sectors. We expect the Building Products 
sub-sector’s revenue to be affected by poor 
demand for property during slow economy 
growth/recession in Europe. For the 
Construction Machinery & Heavy Trucks sub-
sector, slower economy growth/recession in 
Europe should affect construction activity, 
trucks demand, and rolling stock.

EQUITY Factsheet_ Abbott Laboratories,"Highlights
uWe expect 2023 total sales to contract 9%  to 
$39.6 billion, following growth of 1% in 2022. 
Sales in 2021 saw a huge boost from the surge 
in demand for Covid-19 tests, which brought in 
revenue of approximately $7.7 billion for ABT, or 
18% of total sales. We expect Covid-19 sales 
will drop to $1.4 billion in 2023 (vs. $8.4 billion 
in 2022), as demand wanes following the end of 
the public health emergency.   We see total sales 
returning to 5% growth in 2024 with 
acceleration in key franchises such as Alinity 
(Diagnostic systems), Freestyle Libre 
(Diabetes), and MitraClip (Heart).
uThe pandemic upset ABT’s high growth 
segments: medical devices and non-Covid-19 
diagnostics. In  2023,   we anticipate continued 
recovery in physician visits and elective 
procedure volumes driving growth in ABT’s non-
Covid-19-related businesses, allowing ABT to 
limit its sales decline as Covid-19 testing 
demand tapers. Stripping the impacts of Covid-
19 sales and FX, we forecast 2023 organic sales 
growth  in the high-single digits.
uWe forecast a 18% Y/Y EPS drop for ABT in 
2023, but see record EPS of $5.58 by 2026 as 
ABT’s stand-out glucose monitoring technology 
(Freestyle Libre) gains market share.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uWe think shares of ABT will outperform the 
market and peers over the long term, driven by 
its highly innovative diversified health care 
businesses allowing for growing market share 
over time, a  strong financial position, and a 
consistently growing dividend. In 2023, we 
expect ABT sales will fall  as Covid-19 testing 
demand tapers off post-pandemic. But in the 
long run, we think shares have attractive upside 
potential due to ABT’s sustainable earnings 
growth trend driven by a plethora of innovative 
recent and upcoming offerings (e.g., Freestyle 
Libre 3 and structural heart products) across all 
operating segments. We also anticipate strong 
growth in the Diabetes Care medical device 
market.
uRisks to our view include faster-than-expected 
shrinkage in Covid test sales, a recurrence of 
problems related to baby formula production, 
high cost inflation  compressing margins, weak 
execution on new or key product 
commercialization, regulatory delays, and 
unfavorable currency movements.
uOur 12-month target of $130 is 28.1x our 2024 
EPS estimate, above ABT’s five-year forward P/E 
average due to  our view of ABT’s superior long-
term growth trajectory, but below peak levels 
given the Covid testing slowdown.","Industry Outlook
Our fundamental outlook for the health care 
equipment (i.e., medical device) sub-industry for 
the next 12 months is neutral. We anticipate a 
tailwind from a continued recovery in elective 
procedures. We also see at-home Covid-19 test 
sales declining considerably after May 11, 2023, 
when many Americans stopped receiving free 
testing, including at-home kits, as well as 
pharmaceutical Covid-19 treatments. However, 
from a macroeconomic standpoint, we anticipate 
easing inflation throughout 2023 and improving 
supply chains to serve as tailwinds.    
On average, we forecast EPS performance will turn 
a corner and rise 6% in 2023 vs. a 3% decline in 
2022. Over the medium term, we expect growth to 
moderate back toward historical levels as the 
pandemic reaches an endemic state and elective 
procedure volumes return to normal levels. 
Though there may be new Covid-19 variants, we 
don’t expect procedure volumes to decline 
substantially given the progress made by global 
vaccine campaigns. Meanwhile, diagnostics 
companies continue to benefit from the sales of 
Covid-19 tests, though these sales are declining 
on a Y/Y basis. 
A near-term trend benefiting the industry is strong 
outpatient care activity, especially care for seniors. 
For example, there is growth in hip and  knee 
surgeries and related equipment. In the long run, 
we generally see positive fundamental trends for 
medical device manufacturers, including 
increasing global demand for cost-effective value-
based health care, aging populations, and rising 
R&D outlays, which have resulted in a steady flow 
of innovative products and revenue growth. 
The peak of the pandemic was particularly 
advantageous for medical device companies that 
were heavily exposed to Covid-19-related sales, 
and less so for companies exposed to elective 
procedure volumes. We expect 2023 to be a 
weaker year for Covid-19 tests sales. In the long 
run, there will likely still be demand for Covid-19 
testing since physicians will require tests for 
treatment purposes. Also, medical device 
companies that make products supporting drug development and distribution efforts, such as 
Danaher (DHR), have done well during the 
pandemic, though we anticipate weaker 
performance to come as demand wanes.
We continue to see little regulatory or 
legislative risk to the medical device industry, 
especially after the most recent challenge to 
the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was dismissed by 
the Supreme Court.
Meanwhile, the M&A environment appears to 
be lukewarm, with deal counts down in recent 
years. However, we think deal counts bottomed 
in 2022 and will begin to turn a corner in 2023. 
M&A activity is likely to center on companies 
looking to take advantage of trends 
accelerated by the pandemic, such as the 
adoption of remote monitoring and telehealth.
Starting in 2024, we expect the medical device 
industry to grow sales in the range of 6%-8% 
annually, driven by recovering demand, new 
product sales, growing emerging market 
exposure, and some Covid-19 test sales. On 
average, we expect operating margins in 2023-
2024 will be slightly higher than 2019 levels 
(pre-pandemic), particularly for companies 
heavily exposed to elective procedures. 
Year to date through August 18, the S&P 1500 
Health Care Equipment Index was up 1.1% vs. -
2.0% for the Health Care Sector and 13.1% for 
the S&P 1500 Composite Index. In 2022, the 
Health Care Equipment Index contracted 20%, 
the same as the Composite Index; the Health 
Care Sector fell 3.6% in 2022.

EQUITY Factsheet_ AbbVie Inc.,"Highlights
uIn 2023, we expect revenue growth of about 
$53.2 billion, a decrease of 8.4% Y/Y, as the 
anticipated decline in Humira sales is partially 
offset by fast-growing immunology drugs 
Skyrizi and Rinvoq. The 2020 acquisition of the 
former Allergan also brought in significant 
growth contributors in medical aesthetics and 
neuroscience areas. These latter areas 
contributed almost $12 billion in revenues in 
2022. 
uABBV’s revenues have historically been largely 
tied to sales of its blockbuster drug, Humira, 
which began to experience biosimilar 
competition outside of the U.S. (OUS) in October 
2018. In 2022, U.S. Humira sales grew 7.4% 
versus 2021, while OUS sales of Humira 
declined 22%. In 2023, we expect overall Humira 
sales to drop 32% Y/Y.
uAt the end of March 2023, ABBV had net debt of 
$55.8 billion (a decline of $12 billion since the 
end of 2021). In February 2023, ABBV guided to 
a 2023 debt reduction of $4 billion. We note 
that 12 months ago, in February 2022, ABBV 
had guided to debt reduction of $12 billion in 
2022, which it successfully achieved. Even with 
likely reduced earnings in 2023, we think the 
current goal on debt reduction is achievable.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uOur opinion on shares of Abbvie is Hold following 
the Q2 earnings release. The near term has 
looming headwinds (notably the 2023 loss of 
exclusivity for Humira, which contributed $21.2 
billion of 2022 net revenues, 37% of ABBV’s 
total revenues), although the company has two 
relatively new immunology drugs, Skyrizi and 
Rinvoq, to assist the growth profile after 2023. 
We note that these two latter drugs contributed 
more than $2.8 billion in revenues in Q2 2023. 
Management sees a combined potential for 
these two drugs for more than $15 billion by 
2025 (an implied CAGR of at least 52%). 
However, we also note that ABBV’s aesthetics 
segment, which ranked fourth in the company 
at roughly around 11% of revenues, is largely a 
cash-pay business by consumers, and if the U.S. 
enters a steep recession it could be exposed to 
risk of weakening demand. 
uRisks to our target price and opinion include 
favorable/unfavorable regulatory rulings; 
litigation risk; worse-than-expected uptake of 
high-growth drugs; and stronger Humira sales. 
uOur 12-month target price of $152, 13.1x our 
2024 EPS estimate, is slightly above ABBV’s 10-
year historical forward P/E average, and merited 
by growth potential from Skyrizi and Rinvoq.","Industry Outlook
We have a neutral outlook on the biotech sub-
industry. We expect lower demand for Covid-19 
vaccines and treatments Y/Y, despite recent 
upticks in cases and hospitalizations globally,  
which may continue through Q1 2024. The Biden 
administration declared the end of the Covid-19 
Health Emergency in May, which means that going 
forward, Covid-19 vaccines and therapies are no 
longer free. We expect Covid-related activity to 
evolve to an endemic stage vs. a pandemic stage, 
which may lengthen the revenue stream but likely 
at a more subdued level.
Reducing drug costs has been a bipartisan issue in 
the past few years, and the passage of the 
Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) included new 
legislation enabling Medicare to directly negotiate 
pricing on the top 10 branded drugs. The act will 
have no near-term impact, but it will affect pricing 
effective January 2026, and it will expand to 20 
branded drugs by 2028. In August, the CMS posted 
the first list of the 10 prescription drugs selected 
for negotiation. Two biotech firms’ drugs are on 
the list: (i) Enbrel, manufactured by Amgen to 
treat psoriasis and arthritis; and (ii) Imbruvica, co-
developed and commercialized by Abbvie and JNJ 
to treat cancer. During June 2022–May 2023, 
Medicare Part D spending on Enbrel and Imbruvica 
was $2.79B and  $2.66B, respectively. From a 
company perspective, we do not see a strategic 
change based on the IRA in the near term; yet, 
there is a risk that the act has future implications 
as to where companies decide to invest in the 
future.
We think that the FTC appears to be taking a more 
active stance on antitrust review. We are seeing 
increased scrutiny for potential biopharma M&A 
activity, which may result in delays in approvals 
and higher deal making costs, in our view. The FTC 
filed a lawsuit against Amgen in May for its $28B 
acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics on the 
grounds that Amgen can pressure insurers and 
pharmacy benefit managers to accept higher 
prices for Horizon’s drugs. In a surprise move in 
August, however, the FTC decided to pause its 
challenge to the deal. In October, Amgen successfully closed the acquisition of Horizon, 
slightly later than anticipated. Following this 
move, we see reduced concerns on Pfizer’s 
$43B acquisition of cancer drugmaker Seagen 
around antitrust scrutiny. The deal is expected 
to close by year-end  2023.
In the long run, the growth of the biotech 
industry depends on the volume of new therapy 
approvals. The number of  approvals hit a high 
water mark in 2018 (61), although 2019-2021 
levels have been in a range of 75%-90% of 
peak, indicating modest drops. In 2022, the 
FDA approved only 37 novel drugs as new 
molecular entities (NMEs) under New Drug 
Applications (NDAs), or as new therapeutic 
biological products under Biologics License 
Applications (BLAs). This is below typical levels 
and under the 2021 level (52 novel drugs). New 
drugs usually take at least five years to reach 
peak sales levels, so if the current pace does 
not improve, it suggests some long-run 
headwinds beginning in 2027. We believe part 
of the recent decline may stem from more FDA 
resources being reallocated to Covid-related 
therapies, but if true, then Covid-19 entering 
an endemic phase may enable the FDA to 
return to pre-Covid activity levels, in our view.
Year-to-date through October 13, the S&P 
1500 Biotech Index was down 3.9% vs. a 11.6% 
rise for the S&P Composite 1500 Index. In

EQUITY Factsheet_ Advanced Energy Industries Inc.,"Highlights
uTight supply conditions hurt AEIS’s ability to 
capitalize on record end market demand in  
2022, but now some key markets have slowed 
coming into 2023 (e.g., Semiconductor 
Equipment, Data Center Computing, and 
Telecom/Networking). We expect revenues to 
decline 8% in 2023 and  rise 8% in 2024, 
assuming AEIS can work through extended lead 
times and chip away at an elevated backlog of 
$645M exiting Q2 due to the downturn in the 
semi equipment market.
uWe estimate AEIS will post a gross margin of 
37%-38.5% for 2023-2024, vs. 37% in 2022, as 
supply chain constraints begin to subside, 
lowering input costs, and new industrial and 
medical design wins come online. We forecast 
an EBIT margin of 12%-14.5% for 2023-2024, 
at continued compressed levels due to lower 
volumes and manufacturing ramps inside of 
2023, down from 16.2% in 2022.
uAEIS’s balance sheet is in a good spot, with 
$455M in cash, net debt of $11M, and low 
leverage (debt-to-EBITDA of 1.5x). AEIS has no 
debt maturities in NTM. We advise investors to 
keep an eye on inventory turnover levels (2.7x in 
Q2 vs. 3.1x in Q1), within historical  range, a 
possible sign AEIS  is better sourcing raw 
materials to meet future demand.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uFollowing an extended period where AEIS’s 
ability to source necessary components and 
capitalize on strong demand trends lagged 
other comparable companies, AEIS has 
recovered operating efficiency with a surge of 
design wins coming online to aid growth. We 
expect several more design wins in telecom and 
networking and industrial and medial markets, 
but our overall outlook is cautiously optimistic 
about management’s ability to meet both near- 
and long-term targets. We positively view the 
completed acquisition of SL Power Electronics, 
which expanded AEIS’s serviceable addressable 
market by ~$400M to become a key player in 
medical power. We expect return on invested 
capital (ROIC) to expand to over 10% for the 
combined entity post synergies.
uRisks include weaker-than-expected growth in 
the global economy and/or a drop in 
semiconductor demand. An inability to meet 
long-term financial goals could also hurt the 
stock, in our view.
uOur 12-month target of $114 is a P/E of 19x our 
2024 EPS view, in line with the one-year 
average. Our conviction in AEIS’s ability to meet 
three-year goals (established in Q4 2020) of 
$7.50 in adj-EPS and a 20%+ ROIC is reduced 
following recent operational missteps.","Industry Outlook
We have a neutral fundamental outlook for the 
electronic equipment and instruments sub-
industry. Electronic equipment and instrument 
products range from thermal, radiation, and water 
measurement industrial hardware to mobile 
computing, data capture, and real-time location 
systems.
Products and solutions are sold through 
distributors, which strive to properly align 
customers with the needed hardware, software, 
and services. End markets serviced include (but 
are not limited to) retail, transportation, 
manufacturing, health care, warehouse and 
distribution, energy, and utilities.
The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index 
(PMI), a good gauge of health for the Component 
Distributor industry, stood at 49% in September  
2023, which is a 1.4% percentage point increase 
from the August reading of 47.6%. This figure 
marks the first expansion after nine months of 
contraction, following a 30-month period of 
expansion. The new orders and backlog indexes 
contracted, while the customer inventories index 
indicated improved supply chain efficiency as 
output improved and customer inventories 
continued to decline.  The new orders index printed 
49.2% in September, 2.4% above the August 
reading. We expect new orders and PMI to start to 
slowly creep into expansion territory through 2023 
and into 2024.
Across the sub-industry, we expect revenues to be 
flat in  2023, as  benefits from diverse set  of  end 
market growth stories but is weighed on by 
macroeconomic headwinds. Both lingering 
component shortages and slowdown in end 
market demand will likely remain industry 
headwinds for the second half of 2023, but we 
expect progressive improvement in the supply 
chain and factory utilization to help neutralize 
overall effects, as new orders slowdown but many 
participants begin to chip away at elevated 
backlogs.
Longer term, we will be keeping an eye on prior 
areas of strength, such as test and instrument. 
Our hunch is that test and instruments benefits greatly from increasing complexity of 
equipment sub-systems and printed circuit 
boards (PCBs), partially offset by softening 
demand for consumer electronic products. We 
expect qualifications in more nascent areas, 
like big data/artificial intelligence, to help pick 
up the slack and provide a boost in overall 
demand.
Input costs (commodities and raw materials) 
remain volatile and, as a result, present margin 
and mix pressure in  the first half of 2023, but 
are alleviating slightly compared to the second 
half of 2022. Similarly, some pandemic-related 
cost overruns (e.g., freight expenses) could 
restrict profitability, but we think issues have a 
high likelihood of being largely contained 
exiting 2023. Companies continue to 
implement tight cost-control measures, 
leading to greater earnings leverage to help 
offset industry-wide headwinds.
Across the sub-industry, the average cash 
conversion cycle (the time it takes a company 
to turn inventory into cash) was around 60 
days in first half 2023, slightly above  the three-
year average of 94 days. Averages also aligned 
with five-year historical averages, but were 
slightly aided by improved cash collections and 
lower inventories outstanding from the large 
recovery in demand, and potential double 
ordering from select customers.
The S&P Electronic Equipment & Instruments 
Index decreased 1.4% year-to-date through 
October 6, underperforming the S&P 1500 
Composite Index, which  rose 11.2%. In 2022, 
the sub-industry index declined 29.4%, which 
was worse than the 19.1% contraction in the 
S&P 1500.

EQUITY Factsheet_ Aena S.M.E. S.A.,"Highlights
uAena’s Q2 2023 EPS of EUR3.16 beat consensus 
estimates by 19%. The result was buoyed by 
improved passenger traffic in Q2 2023 
(particularly April and May), which brought H1 
2023 volume to 144.1 million passengers 
(+23% Y/Y), exceeding the 2019 level by 0.5%.  
H1 2023 revenue jumped to EUR2.33 billion 
(+24% Y/Y) and EBITDA surged to EUR1.17 
billion (+49% Y/Y) thanks to the strong traffic 
improvement alongside robust commercial 
activities (higher passenger expenditure and 
rents revenue). Consequently, H1 2023 cash 
from operating activities improved to EUR1.05 
billion (+34% Y/Y).
uWe project 13% Y/Y growth in 2023 revenue, 
which is in line with Aena’s 2023 passenger 
traffic estimate of being between 94% to 104% 
of the figures in 2019. Given Aena’s airports 
have a higher composition of leisure travelers, 
we believe our projection is reasonable as we 
think recovery of air travel from China’s 
reopening will add to the traffic recovery 
registered by Aena in 2022. Therefore, we see 
continued strength in 2023 across both 
aeronautical and international activities.
uWe estimate EPS of EUR8.70 for 2023 and 
EUR9.50 for 2024, which reflects a further 
improvement from EPS of 6.01 in 2022.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uOur call is 4-STARS (Buy). As domestic and 
intra-European traffic makes up more than 90% 
of AENA’s total volume, it is one of the best-
placed European airport operators to benefit 
from the ongoing recovery of air travel activities, 
in our opinion. Commercial sales have exceeded 
pre-pandemic levels and the minimum annual 
guaranteed rent of new tenders of Aena’s 
airport spaces has improved. Furthermore, Aena 
is expected to benefit from the increase in 
annual maximum revenue per passenger 
(IMAAJ) for 2024, which set the IMAAJ for 2024 
at EUR10.35 per passenger, versus EUR9.95 per 
passenger in 2023. Long term, we believe 
AENA’s venture into the Brazilian market could 
help to improve its earnings growth trajectory, 
although the size of its international ventures 
remains small relative to its domestic market. 
uMajor downside risks include pullback by 
consumers on travel spending and negative 
regulatory developments in Spain. 
uOur 12-month target price is set at EUR185, 
reflecting a 2024 EV/EBITDA of 12x, a premium 
to the peer average of 11x, justified in our view 
by Aena’s better return on invested capital/ROIC.","Industry Outlook
We maintain our sector recommendation for EMEA 
Industrial sector at neutral for Q4 2023 and 2024. 
We believe that the key issue facing the sector is 
the surge in energy price arising from the concern 
on potential supply disruption from the Middle 
East. However, supply chain disruptions have 
eased. This could be attributed to slower demand 
for goods and weak economy growth in China. In 
the past 12 months, the Shanghai Containerized 
Freight Index (SCFI) has declined about 30% to 
about $900 per TEU. This is a signal of weak 
demand on global movement of cargoes. 
Year to date as of October 16, 2023, the EMEA 
Industrial Index is up 13.0% versus the S&P 
Europe 350 Index increase of 10.0%. However, in 
Q3 2023, the EMEA Industrial sector’s 
performance was at -3.8%, which is below S&P 
Europe 350’s -1.8%.
The eurozone’s annual inflation rate dropped to 
4.3% in September (from August’s 5.2%). We 
expect lower inflation impact to be positive to 
industrial sector earnings as it lowers cost and 
widens operating margin. In Q4 2023, industrial 
players will likely focus on revenue growth via 
business volume increase instead of average 
selling price increases. For Q4 2023, the outlook 
should turn more positive as inflation moderates, 
although this is partially caused by a high base 
case comparison in Q4 2022. However, the growth 
momentum is likely to be slow as the factor of 
China reopening has so far generated little 
demand growth. In our view, industrial players will 
shift their focus to grow volume instead of passing 
on increases in cost as inflation cools down. 
The Eurozone Manufacturing PMI for September 
stands at 43.4, which is little changed compared 
to the August level of 43.5. According to our 
findings, contractions in order book and an output 
decline trend is still ongoing. On the positive side, 
the price of input material has declined and 
manufacturers are passing the cost savings to 
their clients.
Due to the aircraft engine recall issues (PW1100G 
Geared Turbofan Engines), we are now neutral on 
Aerospace & Defense from positive previously. We also lowered our opinion to neutral for Airlines. 
Although airlines players will likely benefit from 
the global aviation sector recovery due to 
Covid-19 normalization, its margin could be 
affected by the spike in jet fuel price (in line 
with the higher crude oil price). 
We are positive on the Industrial Machinery and 
Industrial Conglomerates sub-sectors. 
Industrial Machinery sub-sector players are the 
beneficiaries of high demand due to energy 
efficiency and automation. For Industrial 
Conglomerates, strong demand for 
electrification and sustainability services 
should continue to support revenue growth.
The focus for Trading Companies and 
Distributors will be to reduce the record-high 
inventory in the near term, in our view. This 
may affect their near-term margin, although it 
could lead to stronger cash flow. For the Heavy 
Electrical Equipment sub-sector, the smoother 
supply chain should lead to improvement in 
revenue recognition. However, the intense 
competition should keep the margin upside 
limited.
We are less positive on the Building Products 
and Construction Machinery & Heavy Trucks 
sub-sectors. We expect the Building Products 
sub-sector’s revenue to be affected by poor 
demand for property during slow economy 
growth/recession in Europe. For the 
Construction Machinery & Heavy Trucks sub-
sector, slower economy growth/recession in 
Europe should affect construction activity, 
trucks demand, and rolling stock.

u Q2 sales increased 18% Y/Y (6% organically) on 
positive price realization and strong growth in 
electronics (both residential and 
nonresidential), partially offset by lower volumes 
in the mechanical portfolio.We think ALLE will 
see continued strong demand in its electronics 
business in both residential and nonresidential, 
with resilience in nonresidential coming from 
health care and education, and expect ALLE's 
mechanical portfolio to show continued 
weakness. We also believe the worst of the 
residential headwinds are over, with new 
housing starts increasing Y/Y in May, the first Y/
Y increase since April 2022. We see 2023 and 
2024 sales rising 12.5% and 3%, respectively.
uQ2 adjusted EBIT margin expanded 230 bps Y/Y 
on strong pricing and positive productivity net 
of inflation and investments. We see EBIT 
margin expanding in 2023 with high volumes 
and strong pricing. We forecast 2023 and 2024 
EBIT margin to expand 192 bps and 80 bps, 
respectively.
uWe forecast 2023 and 2024 EPS to rise 18% 
and 6%, respectively. We estimate share 
buybacks of about 1.3M shares in 2023 and 1M 
in 2024, and note that ALLE has a steady 
dividend of 1.4% to our 12-month target.","Investment Rationale/Risk
u Our Buy rating is driven by favorable 
nonresidential construction trends in ‘23 that 
will prioritize security upgrades, coupled with 
our valuation. Nonresidential construction is 
expected to grow 8% in ‘23 and this market 
accounts for about 70% of ALLE’s sales. We 
think ALLE will capitalize on updates and 
renovations in the health care and education (K -
12 & higher education) industries given an 
increased focus on safety and security, and a 
new focus on touchless solutions to promote a 
healthy environment after the Covid-19 
pandemic. We also believe residential security 
systems will be a strong driver of sales.
u Risks include supply chain disruptions, an 
unexpected downturn in budgets for security 
upgrades, and risks associated with ALLE’s 
outstanding and future indebtedness.
u Our 12-month target is $129 on a forward P/E 
of 18x our ‘24 EPS view, above the one-year 
average of 17.3x on strong nonresidential 
demand and our view of stronger-than-
expected residential demand. We note ALLE has 
higher debt levels than peers, with net debt/
EBITDA of 2.2x (peer average: 1.7x), but don’t 
think debt levels will be problematic as we 
forecast FCF to rise about 40% in 2023 on 
strong organic growth and synergies.","Industry Outlook
We have a neutral outlook for the building 
products sub-industry over the next 12 months. 
The residential housing market is seeing lower 
volume and demand due to high interest/
mortgage rates, and we expect this to continue 
through 2023, but improve in 2024 with expected 
rate cuts. In addition, we expect repair & 
remodeling (R&R) activity to decrease primarily 
due to a decrease in existing home sales. Yet, we 
have a positive long-term outlook on the 
residential and R&R markets given the average 
age of U.S. housing stock and historically low 
housing supply relative to demand levels. We see 
positive offset from higher demand for clean 
energy products due to the government’s carbon 
reduction incentives, and a rise in nonresidential 
construction spending.
New home construction is a key factor for future 
growth in residential building products. We believe 
high interest/mortgage rates will have a negative 
impact on new home building in 2023 (average 
30-year mortgage rates are now at a high of 7% 
as of August 2023), but have a positive medium- 
to long-term view as housing inventory remains 
historically low relative to demand levels. As of July 
2023, housing starts have increased 6% since July 
2022, but are still very low relative to historical 
levels. Also, Fannie Mae forecasts housing starts 
to decline by 9% in 2023. Although we think the 
worst of residential is most likely over, we believe 
the rest of 2023 will still show Y/Y weakness, but 
expect modest growth in 2024 with expected rate 
cuts.
We expect R&R spending to be a negative as 
homeowners delay R&R due to declining home 
sales, high interest rates, and higher costs of 
contractor labor. Existing home sales have 
declined 17% in the last year and are expected to 
decline by a total of 13.6% in 2023. Despite the 
drastic Y/Y rise in home prices, which allows 
homeowners more access to capital through 
home equity loans/lines of credit, we think 
homeowners will delay R&R. The Leading Indicator 
of Remodeling Activity, which projects the Y/Y 
change in homeowner improvements and repairs on a four-quarter moving basis, projects 
spending to fall from a reported 9.5% in Q2 to 
an estimated -5.9% by Q2 2024. That said, we 
have a bullish long-term outlook for R&R due 
to the average age of U.S. housing stock, with 
homes in need of home improvements/
remodeling.
We expect government incentives for cleaner 
energy in homes and buildings to be an 
important positive driver in the building 
products industry in 2023 and 2024. Major tax 
credit incentives for home HVAC and rooftop 
solar were included in the energy and climate 
related sections of the Inflation Reduction Act 
of 2022. There are billions in incentives for 
commercial building energy and HVAC systems 
to be decarbonized and we believe this will 
benefit companies focused on clean energy 
and sustainability.
Nonresidential construction spending is also a 
positive driver we foresee in 2023 and 2024. 
Manufacturing, health care, and education 
construction spending have been the main 
growth drivers in 2023, (+71%, +11%, and 
+10%, respectively, since one year ago) and are 
forecasted to increase mid-single digits in 
2024. Additionally, according to the AIA’s most 
recent report in July 2023, ABI for commercial/
industrial rose to 52.7, the highest it’s been 
since June 2022 and institutional remained 
above 50 (positive) at 51.2.
YTD through September 7, 2023, the S&P 1500 
Building Products index is +27%, 
outperforming the S&P 1500 Industrial index 
(+10%) and the S&P 1500 (+15%).

uAmadeus (AMS) delivered a strong performance 
for H1 2023, in line with consensus 
expectations amid the continued strengthening 
of the travel industry, in our view. AMS reported 
revenue of EUR2.7 bln (+28% Y/Y), driven by 
~20-30% broad-based growth in all operating 
segments. This was led by Air Distribution 
revenues, which grew by 31% on the back of a 
17% growth in bookings and an expansion in 
average revenue per booking, followed by Air IT 
Solutions growing by 26% Y/Y, driven by 
passengers boarded evolution which increased 
36.8%. Lastly, Hospitality & Other Solutions 
grew 23.6% from volume growth. We expect the 
continued recovery of air travel to drive 
performance in 2023 and forecast revenue to 
grow by ~21%, within management guidance of 
20%- 22.5%. 
uAMS’s EBITDA grew to EUR1.0 bln, from higher 
contributions which offset the rise in costs. This 
translates to a margin of 38.9% (+360 bps Y/Y), 
just slightly below our expectation of ~40% for 
2023. 
uWe maintain our EPS forecast for 2023 of 
EUR2.30 and for 2024 of EUR2.75.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uWe like AMS for its leading position in the 
industry, which has helped it to gain market 
share. Its long-term contracts with its 
customers also provide strong revenue visibility, 
and we do not foresee the risks of losing major 
customers due to its extensive product 
offerings and high entry barrier in the industry. 
Revenue per booking has been holding up well 
so far, thanks to the positive pricing effect, while 
leverage ratio continued to improve (net debt to 
last-twelve-month EBITDA of 1.1x, within its 
leverage target range of 1.0x-1.5x). We see the 
improvements in air travel demand to continue 
driving AMS’s earnings growth, though it may 
not fully recover to the pre-pandemic level just 
yet in 2023. According to AMS, leisure travel 
continues to recover while the recovery of 
corporate travel still lags behind leisure travel. 
Overall, we find the stock to be fairly valued at 
current valuation. 
uDownside risks include slower macroeconomic/ 
higher inflationary pressure that could lead to 
lower consumer spending, and more travel 
regulations. 
uOur target price is EUR65, implying an EV/ 
EBITDA multiple of 14.6x, above peer average of 
9x, justified in our view by its better margin.","Industry Outlook
We have a positive fundamental outlook over the 
next 12 months for the European Information 
Technology industry, comprising Communications 
Equipment, Semiconductor Equipment, IT 
Services, and Software. The S&P Europe 350 
Information Technology Index was the best 
performing industry year-to-date through 29 
September 2023, gaining 12.0% as compared to 
the 6.5% gain of the broader S&P Europe 350 
Index.
The industry valuation currently trades at a 
premium valuation of 20.3x P/E, to its 5-year 
average of 16x. After being the second worst 
performing industry in 2022 (down 29.7% vs. 
market’s 11.5% contraction), we anticipate that 
the sector is poised for a robust recovery in 2023, 
driven by improvement in supply chain, 
acceleration of digital offerings, and increasing 
demand for technologies such as 5G, AI, and edge 
computing. Also, the valuation seems attractive 
against its EPS growth projections of 17.8% and 
14.3% for 2023 and 2024, which are a lot higher 
than the 8.1% EPS growth in 2022.
For Communications Equipment, we view the 
continued rapid consumption of data, buoyed by 
the proliferation of tablets and smartphones, as a 
solid long-term growth driver for the industry. That 
said, according to Dell’Oro’s report in January 
2023, after four years of extraordinary growth that 
propelled the radio access network (RAN) market 
to reach new record levels, the RAN market is now 
expected to transition from the expansion phase 
to the next phase it this 5G journey with more 
challenging comparisons and slower growth. 
According to the report, global RAN is projected to 
grow at zero percent CAGR outside of China. 
However, 5G RAN is expected to grow another 25% 
to 30% by 2027.
For the Semiconductor sub-industry, we believe 
foundry customers are sustaining increasingly 
elevated levels of investments, while memory 
customers face larger headwinds (softening 
demand and lower ASPs) and are more likely to cut 
capex meaningfully. With China controlling and 
increasing amount of the supply chain, the U.S. and Europe are both looking to boost their own 
chip manufacturing presence, which we believe 
will be done via smaller and less efficient fabs, 
boosting wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) 
capital intensity, and benefiting equipment 
suppliers.
In the IT Services and Software industries, we 
have a positive fundamental outlook. In an 
increasingly “cloud world”, the distinction 
between application software and systems 
software becomes fuzzier and less investment 
relevant, as client-server era’s clear 
demarcations dissolve into an increasingly 
distributed and functionally federated micro-
services architecture. We expect strong 
revenue growth in 2023, primarily driven by 
cloud migration and digital transformation 
projects, partially offset by declining revenues 
from legacy client-server software licenses and 
maintenance and support, which are now 
falling faster as enterprises look to cut costs 
through cloud migration and other 
rationalizations.

EQUITY Factsheet_ Amazon.com Inc. (1),"Highlights
uWe forecast 11% revenue growth in 2023, up 
from 9% in 2022, broken down as such: first-
party online sales (+4%); physical stores (+5%); 
third-party seller services (+19%); subscription 
services (+12%); advertising (+23%); and AWS 
(+14%). On the bottom line, we forecast $28.9B 
of operating income in 2023 vs. $12.2B in 2022, 
with operating margins expanding to 5.1% vs. 
2.4% in 2022.
uIn e-commerce, AMZN is making major strides 
in lowering its cost to serve, while also 
increasing Prime delivery speeds. In advertising, 
AMZN is capturing more digital-ad share, and 
we see this business growing from $38B in 
2022 to $56B by 2024. In AWS, we believe 
growth troughed in 2Q 2023 at 12%, as we 
forecast modest acceleration in 2H 2023 and 
stronger growth in 2024 (+19%), partly driven 
by new opportunities in generative AI, machine 
learning, and large language models.
uFree cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis 
turned positive in 2Q 2023. We see AMZN driving 
long-term sustainable free cash flows, driven by 
operating profit improvement, improvements in 
working capital, and lower capex. We note capex 
grew at a 48% CAGR between 2018 and 2022. In 
2023, AMZN plans to cut back on fulfillment and 
transportation capex.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uOur opinion is Buy. We think all the pieces are 
coming together for AMZN, as 2Q 2023 
demonstrated remarkable operating profit 
improvement in the e-commerce business, 
stellar growth in the advertising business, and 
the trough of the cloud computing cycle. With 
more e-commerce efficiencies left to be 
unlocked, along with faster growth in higher-
margin business streams like AWS and 
advertising, we believe there is significant 
operating profit upside over the next several 
years versus current consensus. Shares still 
look cheap trading at about 15x forward adj-
EBITDA vs. 12x-30x historical trading range.
uRisks to our opinion and target price include 
legal and regulatory challenges (e.g., claims, 
litigation, government investigations), rising 
competition in e-commerce and cloud services, 
and overall challenging macroeconomic 
conditions.
uOur 12-month target price of $183 is calculated 
using an EV/EBITDA multiple of 17x against our 
2024 adjusted EBITDA estimate of $115.0B 
(+12% Y/Y; +37% Y/Y in 2023). This multiple is 
at the lower end of AMZN’s long-term trading 
range (12x-30x), justified by the uncertain 
macro environment, including recession risk in 
2024.","Industry Outlook
Our 12-month fundamental outlook for the 
Broadline Retail sub-industry is neutral. On the top 
line, comparable sales growth is generally 
moderating, driven by weak consumer 
discretionary spending, the lapping of prior-year 
price increases, and normalizing post-pandemic 
demand trends. However, on the bottom line, there 
are various puts and takes to profitability. For 
example, tailwinds include lower freight/
transportation costs, moderating input cost 
inflation, and stronger productivity savings. 
However, headwinds include greater promotional 
activity, increased shrinkage (e.g., theft), higher 
wages, and higher interest expense.
Inflation, as measured by the consumer price 
index (CPI) was 3.0% Y/Y in June 2023, which is 
slightly above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2% 
but well below the June 2022 high of 9.1%. The 
core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, 
was 4.8% in June 2023, down from the March 
2022 high of 6.5%. Headline CPI has now been 
below core CPI for four consecutive quarters. We 
note goods inflation has come down meaningfully 
over the past year, but services and shelter 
inflation has remained stickier.
The labor market has been much stronger than 
expected, although there are signs it is beginning 
to cool down. The unemployment rate was 3.6% as 
of June 2023, near the pre-pandemic level of 
3.5%. The number of job openings was 9.8 million 
as of May 2023, down from the March 2022 peak 
of 12.0 million but well above the historical 
average of about 4 million-6 million job openings. 
In terms of job creation, 209 thousand jobs were 
added in June, below the 240 thousand estimate 
and generally below the rate of job growth over the 
past few years. In terms of average hourly 
earnings, wages grew 4.4% Y/Y in June 2023, 
down from the March 2022 peak of 5.9% but well 
above historical levels (about 2%-3% Y/Y).
Consumers built up savings during the first few 
years of the pandemic. We believe consumers still 
have some of these savings left. Our analysis 
estimates consumer excess savings sitting just 
above $1 trillion, which is down from the late-2021 peak of nearly $2.5 trillion. Based on the 
current trends, we forecast this excess savings 
pool becoming fully depleted during the first 
half of 2024. 
A key headwind to consumer spending toward 
the end of summer and the beginning of fall 
will be the resumption of federal student loan 
payments. The Biden administration agreed 
not to extend the three-year moratorium on 
federal student loan payments as part of the 
debt ceiling deal it cut with Republicans. At the 
same time, the Supreme Court turned down 
the Biden administration’s plan to forgive up to 
$20,000 in federal student loans for qualified 
borrowers. As a result, the nearly 27 million 
borrowers who have a total of $1.1 trillion in 
student loans will need to resume payments 
starting October 1. Average monthly payments 
will be about $400.
In March 2023, there were several changes 
made to the Global Industry Classification 
Standard (GICS) structure. A key update was 
retailers will be classified based on the nature 
of goods sold rather than according to the 
underlying technology used to deliver the 
product/service. As a result, the General 
Merchandise Stores and Department Stores 
sub-industries were merged into a new sub-
industry (Broadline Retail), which also includes 
certain retailers from the now discontinued 
Internet & Direct Marketing Retail sub-industry 
(e.g., AMZN, EBAY, ETSY).

EQUITY Factsheet_ American Express Company (2),"Highlights
uFollowing 25% revenue growth in 2022, we 
estimate total revenue growth of 14%-16% in 
2023. Historically, growth has been slow for AXP 
with revenue compounding at under 2% a year 
from 2011-2020. However, AXP’s products have 
begun to resonate with Millennial/Gen Z 
customers and AXP has been able to acquire 
new card holders at an accelerated rate. In Q2 
2023, revenue growth decelerated to 12% as 
discount revenue (56% of revenue) grew just 
8% given a slowdown in consumer spending. 
uStrength was seen in net interest income 
(+32% and 21% of revenue) as results 
benefited from strong loan growth and net 
interest yield expansion. Net card fees grew 
21% in the second quarter and have risen to 
12% of total revenue vs. 8.5% in 2018. We view 
card fees as a differentiator for AXP as they 
continue to be a consistent revenue driver with 
unimpeded double-digit growth in each of the 
last 20 quarters. 
uTotal Network volume growth slowed to 9% from 
16% last quarter. Positively, AXP has responded 
to slowing spending trends with prudent 
expense management and we note marketing 
spend fell 6% Y/Y. In Q2, net charge-offs (NCOs) 
came it at 2.1% vs. 1.1% in the prior year and 
pre-pandemic average of 2.4%-2.8%.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uOur Strong Buy opinion reflects AXP’s improved 
credit profile. AXP came into the pandemic with 
industry leading credit quality given its wealthy 
customer base which is less prone to defaults 
than peers. Despite this, AXP was not content 
and we have been encouraged by further credit 
improvements. These upgrades have shown up 
in NCOs, which remain well below pre-pandemic 
levels. The same can’t be said for the whole 
industry as most companies have hit pre-
pandemic credit quality or even deteriorated 
past it. Additionally, card fees have shown 
positive momentum with an impressive 70% of 
new accounts coming on to fee-based 
products. 
uRisks are higher-than-anticipated net charge-
offs and delinquencies, leading to more 
provisioning expense; intensifying competition, 
leading to higher rewards and marketing 
expenses; and a decrease in consumer 
spending and loan balances. 
uOn July 21, we increased our 12-month target 
price by $25 to $235, applying a forward P/E of 
18.3x our 2024 earnings estimate, a wider risk 
premium than the peer average of 7.3x given 
more consistent earnings performance, lower 
credit risk, and superior growth prospects.","Industry Outlook
We have a positive fundamental outlook on the 
consumer finance sub-industry. Within the sub-
industry, our outlook is more positive for 
companies with a prime and affluent customer 
base, while we are more cautious on companies 
that target subprime customers.
Despite U.S. credit card debt recently surpassing 
the $1 trillion mark, we believe loan balances still 
have room to run. Although staggering on the 
surface, credit card loans comprise just 6% of 
consumer debt. In fact, credit card debt is just 
22% of discretionary debt and one-twelfth the size 
of consumer mortgages. As such, we believe credit 
card issuers are in a favorable position to see 
above-trend loan growth rates for several years 
without a serious threat of overburdening their 
target customers. To provide some perspective, 
before the pandemic, when the economy was 
relatively strong in 2017-2019, credit card debt 
varied from 6.0% to 6.6% of consumer debt. 
Furthermore, when accounting for inflation, credit 
card debt is up just 3% over the past five years 
and is down 10% over the past 20 years. 
We expect credit quality deterioration to slow in 
upcoming quarters. Negative headlines have been 
rampant in recent months as significant Y/Y credit 
deterioration has been observed for all major 
credit card issuers. However, it’s important to note 
that credit quality was historically strong coming 
out of the pandemic as consumers were flush with 
cash; thus, Y/Y comparisons are disingenuous, in 
our view. Instead, if we compare to 2019 levels, we 
find that credit quality is in line or even slightly 
stronger than this pre-pandemic benchmark. 
Don’t get us wrong, we do expect credit quality to 
deteriorate further in upcoming quarters, but we 
think this expected degradation has more than 
been accounted for in the industry’s depressed 
multiples. 
Over the past few years, interest in Buy Now, Pay 
Later (BNPL) solutions exploded as they are often 
interest-free, allow consumers to spread out 
payments of products, and have a fast approval 
process that does not require good credit. 
Merchants tend to be supporters of BNPL solutions as customers often spend 
significantly more than when paying with other 
methods. However, given the rapid tightening 
by the Fed, we expect BNPL growth to be 
slower than previously expected as funding for 
such technology slows, given it targets at-risk 
Americans who are far more likely to default in 
recessionary times. The past few years have 
not been kind to BNPL, with valuations 
plummeting and, as a result, we see the 
slowdown in BNPL as an opportunity for 
incumbent credit and debit card issuers to 
perfect their own BNPL solutions. 
The consumer finance sub-industry is 
dominated by credit card issuers (nearly 90% 
of revenue). Smaller contributions come from 
student loan servicers, debt collectors, and 
non-bank lenders, as well as chains of pawn 
shops.
Year-to-date through September 22, the S&P 
Consumer Finance sub-industry was up 0.8%, 
compared to the broader Financials sector 
down 2.4% and the S&P 1500 Index up 11.6%. 
The sub-industry was down 20.8% in 2022, the 
Financials sector was down 12.1%, and the

2% decline in adjusted operating revenues 
(lagging our forecast of a 3% to 6% rise), as a 
5% rise in Wealth Management revenues was 
offset by a 26% drop in Asset Management 
revenues and flat Retirement & Protection 
revenues. Margins were aided by  well-contained  
operating costs. We expect growth in 2023 to 
remain pressured by mixed market 
performance, which is masking some decent 
growth trends in AMP’s wealth management 
unit. 
uWe forecast adjusted EBIT margins of about 
29% to 31% in 2023, versus 29.9% reported in 
the fourth quarter of 2022 (that was an 
improvement over 2021’s 22.3%).  This follows a 
multi-year period of mixed margin trends, 
beginning in 2014, when EBIT margins were 
29.4% and steadily declined to 26.4% in 2015, 
and to 21.3% in 2016, before climbing again to 
25.7% in 2017 and 27.2% in 2018, and declining 
to 23.6% in 2019. 
uWe expect a share buyback program will reduce 
the net share count by over 5% annually, 
producing operating EPS of $30.30 in 2023 and 
rising to $33.15 in 2024, and to $36.60 in 2025.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uOur Buy recommendation reflects our view that 
AMP shares are undervalued versus peers and 
historical levels. We think AMP’s ability to 
produce above-peer levels of revenue growth 
and expand margins in its core Advice & Wealth 
Management division should support the 
shares’ current valuation. Our view is tempered 
by some mixed growth and profitability trends in 
AMP’s asset management and annuity units. 
However, we expect AMP will take additional 
restructuring actions to shore up these units.
uRisks to our recommendation and target price 
include potential market depreciation, lower 
interest rates, and regulatory costs. There is 
also a risk that AMP has to increase long-term 
care insurance reserves.
uOur 12-month target price of $400 reflects a 
multiple of 12.1x our 2024 EPS estimate of 
$33.15 and 10.9x our 2025 EPS estimate of 
$36.60, versus AMP’s 10-year average forward 
multiple of 11x and the peer average of 12x, 
reflecting improved results in the core Advice & 
Wealth Management unit and steps the 
company has taken to shore up results in other 
areas, partly offset by some relative equity 
underperformance, and the company’s slower-
growing, more capital-intensive mix of business.","Industry Outlook
We have a neutral fundamental outlook for the 
asset management and custody banks sub-
industry. We think the long-term outlook is 
relatively healthy due to aging populations and a 
fairly healthy employment picture, despite the 
potential for some near-term volatility as markets 
react to higher interest rates and inflation. 
Demographic trends remain favorable, as 
millennials come of age and baby boomers play 
“catch-up” with contributions to IRAs, driving a 
significant increase in retirement investments, in 
our view. Millennials are also maturing and 
beginning to save for retirement. We see upside 
potential for asset managers with solid 
reputations, better-than-average fund 
performance, and strong management. Many of 
the companies in this sub-industry will also 
benefit from recently enacted legislative initiatives 
designed to encourage saving for retirement.
These positive longer-term factors are offset by 
some structural and secular changes within the 
industry, including a shift in investor preferences 
to ETFs and away from actively managed assets. 
Near-term market volatility will also impact many 
equity funds. Within this relatively broad-based 
sub-industry classification are companies 
engaged in asset management, trust and 
processing, and private equity activities. Each of 
these different entities’ business models are 
influenced to varying degrees by changes in 
interest rates and by an array of industry-specific 
competitive dynamics. Within the asset 
management industry, there are some negative 
factors pressuring many firms. An ongoing shift 
out of active equity investments and into passive 
and fixed income investments has exerted 
downward pressure on fee revenues for most 
firms.
Growth in assets under management (AUM) is a 
key driver for many firms in this industry. It’s 
important to differentiate between asset growth 
due to positive fund flow trends and asset growth 
due to market appreciation. AUM levels for most 
firms declined in 2022 along with the broader 
market averages, exacerbated by over $1 trillion in net outflows in 2022, with actively managed 
equity funds seeing the most dramatic 
outflows. First quarter results improved a bit, 
marked by $706 billion of net inflows. As a 
result, results in recent periods have varied 
widely by firm, depending on the level of 
organic AUM growth. A negative trend that 
continues to linger is AUM growth, which does 
not directly translate to a similar rate of 
revenue growth due to increasing amounts of 
AUM flowing into lower revenue-producing, 
passively-managed assets.
At March 31, 2023 (latest available)  assets in 
all worldwide open-end funds totaled $63.1 
trillion, up from $60.1 trillion at year-end 2022. 
Equity assets continue to dominate the 
invested asset mix, accounting for more than 
45% of the total asset base. Bond funds 
account for about 19% of the invested asset 
total, money market assets for 15%, and other 
funds (including real estate and balanced 
funds) account for the remaining 21% of  fund 
assets.   
A decline in asset values amid actions taken by 
the Federal Reserve to tame inflation led to a 
21.7% drop in the S&P Asset Management & 
Custody Banks Index, versus a 19.1% decline in 
the S&P 1500 Index, during 2022. This was a 
sharp reversal from 2021, when a market 
recovery propelled the Asset Management & 
Custody Banks Index up by 31.9%, versus a 
26.7% rise in the S&P 1500 Index. Year-to-
date through August 11, 2023,  the Asset 
Manager Index fell by 0.5%, versus a 15.70% 
rise in the S&P 1500.

uWe forecast revenue growth of 5% in 2023 and 
6% in 2024, after increasing by 6.4% in 2022 
and 15.8% in 2021. The reopening of on-
premise bars and restaurants as Covid-19 
restrictions were lifted was a strong top-line 
tailwind in both 2021 and 2022. ABI’s worldwide 
volume growth totaled just 2.3% in 2022 (beer 
volume was +1.8% and non-beer volume was 
+5.2%) after a 9.6% increase in 2021 due to the 
waning of the reopening “boom.” Like many 
beverage companies, ABI has leveraged the 
value of its brands to pass through higher costs 
to consumers in the form of price increases in 
recent quarters. We think concerns about the 
recent consumer backlash over the Bud Light 
brand are overblown, considering the company's 
global portfolio of over 500 beer brands.
uWe expect the gross margin to contract slightly 
in 2023 from last year’s level of 54.5%. ABI’s 
gross margins contracted 300 bps to 54.5% in 
2022 due to inflationary pressures on 
ingredients and packaging. In particular, 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine beginning in 
February 2022 caused a surge in the cost of 
barley and hops.
uWe forecast adjusted EPS of $3.10 for 2023 and 
$3.60 for 2024, up from $3.07 in 2022 and 
$2.85 in 2021, primarily due to higher prices.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uWe rate ABI  a Hold with a 12-month target of 
EUR55, based on a 2024 P/E of 16.7x, a 
discount to its five-year mean forward P/E of 
20.8x. ABI’s EV/EBITDA multiples are slightly 
below  peer comps, reflecting BUD’s continued 
efforts to deleverage towards its 2x net debt/
EBITDA target. BUD has steadily brought down 
its net debt/EBITDA ratio from 4.8x at year-end 
2020 to 4.0x at year-end 2021 and 3.5x at year-
end 2022, although it ticked higher to 3.7x at 
mid-year 2023. We prefer other brewers but 
acknowledge that ABI’s low beta and more 
defensive characteristics could appeal to some 
investors in the current environment.
uWe have been somewhat cautious on ABI 
despite the prospects of better profitability as 
the ongoing volume recovery and reopening of 
trade continues. Furthermore, net debt has 
decreased slightly as cash flows improve and 
sales pick up. Nonetheless, ABI’s still-elevated 
leverage reduces its financial flexibility.
uKey downside risks include (i) lower-than-
expected synergies following the merger with 
SAB Miller; (ii) a return to weakness in beer 
volumes particularly within the North and South 
American markets; and (iii) an inability to pass 
on higher input costs as commodity costs spike.","Industry Outlook
CFRA is positive on the 12-month fundamental 
outlook for the European Consumer Staples 
sector, reflecting our preference towards less 
cyclical and more defensive sectors. The sector 
was down 1.6% year-to-date (YTD) through 
September 30, 2023, underperforming the 
broader market – S&P Europe 350 Index – which 
recorded a gain of 6.5% during the same period. 
The adverse impact of energy crisis is seen 
subsiding alongside supply chain constraints. For 
context, the annual inflation in the eurozone is 
seen declining to its lowest level since October 
2021, falling to 4.3% in September 2023. The FAO 
Food Price Index averaged 121.5 pts in September 
2023, moderating on a monthly basis, but is still 
higher than the 98.1 pts recorded in 2020.
Among the sub-sectors, we remain attracted to 
the defensiveness of the Consumer Staples 
Distribution & Retail sub-sector as consumers 
look for avenues closer to homes while also 
seeking value amid cost-of-living pressures. The 
sub-sector maintained outperformance on strong 
YTD gain of 13.1% through September 30, 2023. 
We think the improving inflation outlook will 
contribute to stable market shares moving 
forward. Note that discounters have gained 
market shares at the expense of the constituents 
during early 2022 to mid-2023. Although cost of 
wages will continue to pressure margins, We still 
see potential for margin expansion, driven by 
successful negotiations with food suppliers on 
declining input prices.
We remain positive on the Household & Personal 
Care Products (HPC) sub-sector. The sub-sector 
outperformed the broader sector by gaining 5.1% 
YTD through September 30, 2023. We see 
moderating commodity prices, which should lead 
to improved margins. The sub-sector can be seen 
shifting towards volume growth, which may be 
volatile and uncertain, but we think it is the right 
direction for sustainable growth with customer 
loyalty in mind. Note that HPC producers have 
been struggling to fully pass-through cost 
inflation without impact on volume due to limited 
pricing power. Stabilizing input cost could help HPC to support advertising and promotional 
activities to enhance brand equity, which will be 
important in driving market share gains, in our 
opinion. We note that the HPC sub-sector is 
trading at a premium to the overall consumer 
staples sector, which fairly reflects its higher 
relative growth potential.
We remain positive on the Food, Beverage, and 
Tobacco subsector. The sub-sector 
underperformed the broader sector with return 
of -6.1% YTD through September 30, 2023. We 
see stable earnings and attractive cash flow for 
tobacco companies as we project the 
successful implementation of tobacco 
alternatives in both developed and emerging 
markets. Food companies are expected to stay 
resilient, while breweries have unexpectedly 
run into volume headwinds in certain regions. 
Nevertheless, we expect continued product 
innovation from beverage players/brewers to 
support revenue/volume growth, with room for 
margin expansion from moderating commodity 
input prices.

between 12% and 17% in 2023 and 2024  on 
more muted market performance expectations, 
aided by strong asset inflows. Revenue growth 
in 2022 was partly supported by the January 
2022 acquisition of approximately 65% of 
Athene Holding Ltd. (ATH) that APO did not 
already own. We expect this $11 billion 
acquisition to be accretive.
uAssets under management (AUM) as of June 30,

uBALL installed 12 billion units of aluminum can 
capacity in 2021, mostly in North America, a 
region initially forecast to grow can volume by 
10%-12% in 2022. However, weaker demand in 
North America in 2022 (shipments down 0.3%) 
led to capacity closures at certain locations. We 
expect a 3% sales decline  in 2023, with flat 
organic volumes  offset by the Russian 
divestiture. We forecast flat 2023 global  
volumes, with North America down low-single 
digits, South America up mid-single digits, and 
EMEA up mid-single digits.
uLeading up to 2022, BALL had been operating at 
full capacity in North America and had been in 
an oversold position. Therefore, BALL had been 
expanding capacity, with an emphasis on North 
and South America. BALL ’s capacity expansions 
were targeting an increase of 25% global 
capacity by year-end 2023 (off of a 2019 base). 
However, weaker demand led to geographic 
mismatches in supply and demand and future 
capacity growth should be muted. 
uYear-end net debt-to-trailing-EBITDA in 2022 
was 4.3x (an increase from 3.4x in 2021). 2023 
capex should be $1.2 billion (versus $1.7 billion 
in 2022) and we forecast free cash flow of $750 
million, which we think will be used to reduce 
debt.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uOur Strong Buy view is driven by BALL ’s 
attractive market position in an aluminum can 
market that we think will perform well during 
the current economic weakness and return to 
strong growth thereafter. Cost controls and 
volume growth (as cans continue gaining 
market share from plastic bottles) should help 
expand margins. We have a positive view of 
BALL ’s pending divestiture of its aerospace 
business for $5.6 billion in cash, implying an 
attractive valuation for the unit of 19.6x EV/
EBITDA, well above BALL ’s three-year average 
forward EV/EBITDA of 14.6x. With the net 
proceeds of the deal, BALL should deleverage 
the balance sheet to the low end of the target 
leverage ratio and increase the dividend and 
buybacks. 
uRisks to our outlook and target include less 
favorable exchange rates; lower demand for 
canned beer, soda, and other beverages; weaker 
job markets; and higher raw material, labor, and 
energy costs.
uOur 12-month target price of $72 is 23.2x our 
2023 EPS estimate, above BALL ’s three-year 
average forward P/E multiple of 21.6x. BALL 
trades at a premium to peers, which we think is 
justified given BALL ’s aerospace business (which 
sets it apart from peers) and BALL ’s strong free 
cash flow profile.","Industry Outlook
Our fundamental outlook for the metal, glass & 
plastic containers sub-industry is neutral for the 
next 12 months. In the short term, we forecast 
muted demand growth as price increases on key 
products hurt  demand and consumers face more 
economic uncertainty.
The impact of Covid-19 on this sub-industry was 
bifurcated, depending on where food and drink are 
consumed in particular markets. During lockdown 
measures, at-home consumption helped offset 
and, and in some markets, more than offset the 
decline of on-premise consumption. While many 
consumer trends reversed as economies 
reopened, other shifts in consumption could 
persist.
 We forecast favorable long-term demand trends in 
most markets. Following a prolonged period of 
customers destocking inventory in 2022 and 2023, 
we expect production to continue to be more 
aligned with demand, while inventory build should 
be more seasonal. In our view, operating margins 
will improve as beverage packaging unit volume 
gradually recovers, with demand for higher-margin 
new products such as specialty cans and bottles 
likely to strengthen, while contractual price hikes 
cover most of the higher fuel, freight, and 
commodities costs, when necessary. We also see 
more demand for food and household packaging 
products.
After significant industry consolidation (mostly 
international), including major acquisitions by  Ball 
and Crown Holdings, we expect only smaller tuck-
in acquisitions, as companies instead focus on 
new manufacturing capacity in North and South 
America, to catch up to the surge in demand, 
mostly related to Covid-19 measures, but some 
shifts are structural in nature.
In our view, demand for glass containers will 
gradually recover in Western Europe, North 
America, and the Asia/Pacific region, although 
Southern Europe will likely remain soft until 
economic conditions improve. Global sales of 
beverage cans will likely continue to strengthen, 
especially in China and Brazil. Improved production 
efficiencies and new products, such as easy-open closures on cans and specialty cans, as well as 
lighter-weight glass bottles in new sizes, will 
start to boost sales volume and margins, by 
our analysis.
Strong competition in the same materials or 
substitute forms of packaging has resulted in 
excess capacity in certain countries in the 
past, and can often lead to capacity 
adjustments and significant pricing pressures. 
In recent years, consumer preferences have 
shifted away from major domestic beer brands 
and toward higher demand for wine, spirits, 
and seltzers. Aluminum beverage packaging 
has experienced significant growth in recent 
years, as aluminum cans (as a substrate) have 
been gaining share among new product 
launches and existing products, including beer 
and sparkling waters. This has resulted in 
overcapacity in certain plastic and glass 
markets, while aluminum can producers are 
expanding to meet the surge in demand.
As of August 18, 2023, the year-to-date 
increase for the S&P 1500 Metal, Glass &

We have a neutral outlook for the building 
products sub-industry over the next 12 months. 
The residential housing market is seeing lower 
volume and demand due to high interest/
mortgage rates, and we expect this to continue 
through 2023, but improve in 2024 with expected 
rate cuts. In addition, we expect repair & 
remodeling (R&R) activity to decrease primarily 
due to a decrease in existing home sales. Yet, we 
have a positive long-term outlook on the 
residential and R&R markets given the average 
age of U.S. housing stock and historically low 
housing supply relative to demand levels. We see 
positive offset from higher demand for clean 
energy products due to the government’s carbon 
reduction incentives, and a rise in nonresidential 
construction spending.
New home construction is a key factor for future 
growth in residential building products. We believe 
high interest/mortgage rates will have a negative 
impact on new home building in 2023 (average 
30-year mortgage rates are now at a high of 7% 
as of August 2023), but have a positive medium- 
to long-term view as housing inventory remains 
historically low relative to demand levels. As of July 
2023, housing starts have increased 6% since July 
2022, but are still very low relative to historical 
levels. Also, Fannie Mae forecasts housing starts 
to decline by 9% in 2023. Although we think the 
worst of residential is most likely over, we believe 
the rest of 2023 will still show Y/Y weakness, but 
expect modest growth in 2024 with expected rate 
cuts.
We expect R&R spending to be a negative as 
homeowners delay R&R due to declining home 
sales, high interest rates, and higher costs of 
contractor labor. Existing home sales have 
declined 17% in the last year and are expected to 
decline by a total of 13.6% in 2023. Despite the 
drastic Y/Y rise in home prices, which allows 
homeowners more access to capital through 
home equity loans/lines of credit, we think 
homeowners will delay R&R. The Leading Indicator 
of Remodeling Activity, which projects the Y/Y 
change in homeowner improvements and repairs on a four-quarter moving basis, projects 
spending to fall from a reported 9.5% in Q2 to 
an estimated -5.9% by Q2 2024. That said, we 
have a bullish long-term outlook for R&R due 
to the average age of U.S. housing stock, with 
homes in need of home improvements/
remodeling.
We expect government incentives for cleaner 
energy in homes and buildings to be an 
important positive driver in the building 
products industry in 2023 and 2024. Major tax 
credit incentives for home HVAC and rooftop 
solar were included in the energy and climate 
related sections of the Inflation Reduction Act 
of 2022. There are billions in incentives for 
commercial building energy and HVAC systems 
to be decarbonized and we believe this will 
benefit companies focused on clean energy 
and sustainability.
Nonresidential construction spending is also a 
positive driver we foresee in 2023 and 2024. 
Manufacturing, health care, and education 
construction spending have been the main 
growth drivers in 2023, (+71%, +11%, and 
+10%, respectively, since one year ago) and are 
forecasted to increase mid-single digits in 
2024. Additionally, according to the AIA’s most 
recent report in July 2023, ABI for commercial/
industrial rose to 52.7, the highest it’s been 
since June 2022 and institutional remained 
above 50 (positive) at 51.2.

slight deceleration Q/Q, but still supporting a 
long growth runway. The RMS segment’s 
revenue rose by 13% Y/Y, driven by solid 
demand globally for research models, 
counterbalancing the 4% Y/Y decline in the 
Manufacturing segment. 
uCRL divested its Avian Vaccine business in 
December 2022 after deciding it no longer 
made strategic sense in bringing top- and 
bottom-line growth to the portfolio. The

Manufacturing segment sales.
uCRL continues operating with elevated capital 
spending, likely to hit 9% of revenue in 2023 
(8% in 2022), which is a marked uptick from a

reflection of rising demand from some of CRL ’s 
end markets that entails new capacity and 
represents a good problem to have.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uOur opinion remains Buy, after Q2 earnings 
release. Following strong 1H 2023 results and 
some actions taken to mitigate the impact of 
the Nonhuman primates (NHP) supply 
constraints, we think shares continue to be 
attractive at current valuations. In the long 
term, we expect solid growth driven by the 
expansion of biologic drug research and CRL ’s 
research model capacity investments. While 
most large CROs work on human clinical trials, 
CRL focuses on pre-clinical products and 
services, where we believe it is the clear leader. 
CRL also holds good visibility into 2023 with its 
strong backlog in DSA, strong client pipelines, 
and pricing power. 
uRisks to our recommendation and target include 
a prolonged economic decline in key markets

We have a negative outlook for the life sciences 
tools & services (LSTS) sub-industry for the next 
year. In May 2023, the U.S. government declared 
the end of the Covid-19 health emergency. We 
think this notable change in the health care 
landscape is resulting in additional headwinds for 
a number of LSTS companies. We have already 
seen several companies recording sharp declines 
in Covid-19-related revenues Y/Y in the first half 
of 2023 resulting from large Covid-19 sales 
reversals globally. 
In 2022, the R&D spending of the S&P Global 
1200’s biopharmaceutical companies remained 
modest at 3.2%. In our baseline scenario, we 
anticipate the R&D spending growth to remain 
muted until the second half of 2024 due to 
uncertainties in the global macroeconomic 
environment and more cautious spending from 
biopharma clients. In the first nine months of 
2023, we saw delayed orders as companies were 
worried about inflation, the cost of capital, and 
rising interest rates. While inflation is starting to 
moderate globally, we expect the spending caution 
to remain until the second half of 2024 as 
macroeconomic pressures are persisting globally. 
In Q3, we saw several LSTS companies negatively 
impacted by a prolonged economic slowdown in 
China, a key international market, which translated 
into further deceleration in sales versus Q1 and 
Q2. This softness is expected to persist for the 
rest of the year and part of 2024, creating more 
challenging operating conditions and potentially  
reducing  revenues. In response to a more difficult 
sales environment, we are seeing a number of 
LSTS companies embarking on or extending cost 
management initiatives such as cost savings, 
layoffs, and reducing real estate space to  preserve 
margins.
The National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) budget 
has been growing over the last three years, 
increasing funding for academic and government 
labs. This, in turn, helps drive sales growth for 
many LSTS companies that supply these labs. The 
NIH budget for fiscal year 2023 (Sep.) rose 6.5%, 
which was well below what was desired, around 35%. Yet, this was in line with the hikes in 
recent years in the 5%-7% range. The Senate 
spending panel approved a 2%  increase for the 
FY 2024 NIH budget ($47.8 billion) in July 
2023, slightly below expectations.
The booming economic cycle before Covid-19 
drove a notable increase in M&A activity within 
the LSTS industry. The 2017-2022 period saw 
a notable acceleration in the industry’s 
invested capital growth due to several major 
acquisitions. This was mainly driven by a desire 
to take advantage of a low interest rate 
environment, and by large companies seeking 
to acquire new technologies and business from 
smaller rivals to bolster growth prospects. So 
far in 2023, we have seen a reversal of this 
trend and a cooled down M&A environment for 
LSTS companies given the rise in interest rates.
In August 2021, in a controversial move, ILMN 
decided to complete the $7.1 billion acquisition 
of Grail, which it previously divested in 2016, 
before the European Commission’s review 
conclusion. In April 2023, the FTC  ordered the 
divestiture of Grail due to concerns over 
diminished competition, and in October 2023, 
the European Commission asked Illumina to 
sell Grail in the next 12 months.
Year-to-date through October 27, the S&P 
Composite 1500 Life Sciences Tools & Services

uWe forecast net written premium growth of  9% 
to 15% in  2023 and 8% to 12% in 2024, amid  a  
still-healthy premium pricing environment that 
we expect will  be enhanced by stable demand 
for  commercial lines coverage despite  near-
term economic cross currents.  We expect CB to 
leverage its dominant position in the large 
commercial lines market and produce growth 
above the industry average, possibly  via 
acquisitions (despite its failure to secure a deal 
with The Hartford).  Net written premiums rose 
by 10% in 2022 and 12% in 2021,  a recovery 
from the 4.8% rise posted  in 2020. 
uThe rebound in operating profitability we expect 
in 2023 is skewed by an elevated level of 
weather-related catastrophe losses incurred in 
2022. Covid 19 related claims, however, have 
moderated.  Still, we expect underwriting results 
to remain profitable, and superior to most 
peers, evidenced by the combined ratio that

uOur opinion on the shares is Buy. We think  CB’s 
ability to leverage pricing strength will provide 
the shares with a catalyst. We are also 
encouraged that claim costs  have moderated 
despite higher catastrophes.  We view CB as a 
top-tier underwriter, and believe the 
combination of this strength with a strong 
pricing environment and an increase in demand 
for coverage amid an economy recovery 
provides the shares with a powerful catalyst.  
Long term,  we also see CB poised to gain share 
from weaker competitors in the aftermath of 
this crisis.
uRisks to our opinion and target price include a 
greater-than-forecasted deterioration in claim

uOur 12-month target price of $245 assumes 
the shares will trade at a multiple of 12.1x our

CFRA’s fundamental outlook for the property & 
casualty insurance sub-industry is positive. 
Despite some persistent claim cost inflation and 
some uncertainty over the level of claims 
stemming from the myriad of recent catastrophes,  
industry profitability in most lines of coverage is 
set to improve in 2023 amid an expected easing of 
heavy worldwide catastrophe claims that plagued 
most insurers in recent years. However, these 
losses will likely extract enough excess 
underwriting capacity from the insurance 
marketplace to cause rates for many lines of 
coverage to remain firm. The degree to which 
demand decreases for certain types of insurance 
products, particularly those in the commercial 
lines area, will depend on the health of the broader 
economy in the U.S. and overseas and the degree 
to which they are able to withstand a rise in 
interest rates. Underwriting results in the core 
personal auto and homeowners’  line will likely 
remain unprofitable in 2023, as persistently high 
claims inflation (caused in part by supply chain 
issues) could hamper further margin gains, 
particularly among personal lines auto insurers.   
A firming of rates (particularly in the commercial 
lines segment) will likely propel net written 
premiums by about 7%-10% in 2023 and by 6%-
10% in 2024, in our estimation. This compares 
with the 8.3% rise in net written premiums 
reported in 2022 (in line with our 7%-10% growth 
forecast), and the 8% rise  posted in 2021.  
Operating profitability in the property-casualty 
industry is heavily influenced by the level of 
weather and catastrophe losses. Worldwide 
catastrophe losses totaled about $270 billion in 
2022, down slightly from $280 billion in 2021 and 
below the record of about $350 billion set in 2017. 
Insured losses were around $120 billion in 2022, 
or about 44% of total losses, above a long-term 
average we estimate to be around 40%, but below 
the 51% of catastrophe losses that were covered 
by insurance in 2018, reflecting a shift in the type 
of catastrophes, as fires (which are more 
comprehensively covered by insurance) accounted 
for more of the catastrophes in 2018, while hurricanes (whose flooding is typically 
excluded from insurance coverage) typically 
account for the majority of catastrophes.  
Following the rise in catastrophe losses and an 
uptick in claims costs in several core line of 
coverage (including personal auto), 
underwriting results deteriorated in 2022. As a 
result, the combined (loss and expense) ratio—
a key underwriting metric—deteriorated in 
2022 to 102.7% from 99.6% in 2021, 98.8% in 
2020, and 99.0% in 2019.   
As of March 31, 2023 (latest available), the 
industry had $1 trillion in policyholder surplus 
(or capital), supporting its written premium 
base of about $782 billion. The industry was 
leveraging its capital at less than a 1:1 ratio. 
Assuming a historical (and somewhat 
theoretical) benchmark 2:1 leverage of capital, 
we estimate the industry had “excess” capital 
of over $300 billion. We think this “excess” 
capital (or underwriting capacity) has enabled 
insurers to leverage the firmer pricing 
environment and grow their book of business—
a trend that may continue as demand and 
pricing remain firm.
During 2022, the S&P Property & Casualty 
Insurance Index rose by 12.6%, while the S&P

We have an underweight view on EMEA Materials 
as industries face the effects of high interest rates 
and slower macroeconomic development in 2023. 
This follows the period of high inflation in 2022, 
though the Materials companies themselves have 
been able to pass on high cost prices down the 
supply chain. Prices have eased in 2023 as we 
expected, but volumes are not recovering as 
quickly due to the weaker macroeconomic 
conditions. For the end of 2023, we see some 
increase in prices, though volumes will remain 
lower.
The S&P Europe 350 Materials Index has 
underperformed the market in 2023 up to August 
2023, down 0.9% vs. an 8.2% increase in the 
broader S&P Europe 350 Index during the same 
period. 
For the Metals & Mining sub-sector, the growing 
concern over global economic growth remains a 
key risk to earnings in the short-term in our view – 
Global Copper Users PMI and Global Steel Users 
PMI improved slightly in August vs. July. However, 
this was solely driven by Asia as the U.S. saw a 
renewed deterioration in operating conditions 
while Europe declined further. We note 
ArcelorMittal (one of the largest steel producers) 
also lowered its forecast for global ex-China 
apparent steel demand growth in July to reflect 
the weaknesses in the U.S. and Europe markets 
(weakness in long products demand due to weak 
construction activity). 
For the Construction Materials sub-sector, we 
expect growth to continue to be supported by 
infrastructure spending in the U.S. and, to a lesser 
extent, in Europe. However, other segments of 
construction will continue to be weak, as evident 
by the Eurozone construction PMI not having been 
in expansionary territory since April 2022. The 
weaker macroeconomic conditions make further 
recovery more questionable, in our opinion. 
For the Chemical sub-sector, we continue to see 
growth recovery, particularly for the companies 
that are exposed to industries that have 
undergone major destocking in 2022, as volume 
growth outweighs pricing declines. Overall, we are underweight on the industry due 
to the weaker macroeconomic condition 
despite the breadth of its end markets.

uSGO’s H1 2023 EPS of EUR3.57 (+1.7% Y/Y) 
surpassed the consensus estimate of EUR3.27 
but matched our expectations. In our view, the 
outperformance is attributed to SGO’s ability to 
register record margin of 11.3% (up from H1 
2022’s 11.0%). The 7.9% Y/Y price increase 
outweighed the 6.3% decline in business 
volume. H1 2023 top line was down 2.1% Y/Y 
but improved 1.6% Y/Y on a like-for-like basis. 
The company’s balance sheet remains robust, 
with a stable Y/Y net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.2. 
Absolute net debt increased 7.8% to EUR8.92 
billion (from EUR8.27 billion as of end June 
2022).
uWe maintain our non-consensus view that 
SGO’s 2023 earnings will continue to grow. While 
the rise in interest rates has weakened the 
demand from new construction, there is 
resilience in demand from renovation for SGO’s 
products. Regionally, we expect stronger 
earnings from North America and Asia to drive 
the growth. Management guided for operating 
margin of 9%-11% for H2 2023, which is 
achievable in our view due to SGO’s strong 
brand and expertise in providing sustainable 
solutions to the construction industry.
uWe maintain our forecasts: 2023 EPS at 
EUR6.62 and 2024 EPS at EUR6.90.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uOur call is 5-STARS (Strong Buy). First, SGO’s 
focus on margin should result in earnings 
growth with a 3-year forward earnings 
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.6%. 
Second, the company’s “Grow & Impact” plan is 
beginning to show positive results, with a 
significant increase of 270bps in operating 
margin from 2018 to 2022. This trend continues 
in H1 2023 with operating margin improvement 
by 30bps to 11.3%. Finally, SGO’s distinctive 
solutions and product offerings with focus on 
sustainability should allow it to outperform 
peers. In the long run, SGO is well-positioned to 
benefit from the global trend towards 
sustainable construction, renovating high 
carbon footprint buildings, and industrial 
decarbonization.
uKey downside risks are: (i) worse-than-expected 
spike in interest rates causing a slowdown in 
the construction and automotive markets, 
thereby affecting demand for SGO’s products/

forward EV/EBITDA average.","Industry Outlook
We maintain our sector recommendation for EMEA 
Industrial sector at neutral for Q4 2023 and 2024. 
We believe that the key issue facing the sector is 
the surge in energy price arising from the concern 
on potential supply disruption from the Middle 
East. However, supply chain disruptions have 
eased. This could be attributed to slower demand 
for goods and weak economy growth in China. In 
the past 12 months, the Shanghai Containerized 
Freight Index (SCFI) has declined about 30% to 
about $900 per TEU. This is a signal of weak 
demand on global movement of cargoes. 
Year to date as of October 16, 2023, the EMEA 
Industrial Index is up 13.0% versus the S&P 
Europe 350 Index increase of 10.0%. However, in 
Q3 2023, the EMEA Industrial sector’s 
performance was at -3.8%, which is below S&P 
Europe 350’s -1.8%.
The eurozone’s annual inflation rate dropped to 
4.3% in September (from August’s 5.2%). We 
expect lower inflation impact to be positive to 
industrial sector earnings as it lowers cost and 
widens operating margin. In Q4 2023, industrial 
players will likely focus on revenue growth via 
business volume increase instead of average 
selling price increases. For Q4 2023, the outlook 
should turn more positive as inflation moderates, 
although this is partially caused by a high base 
case comparison in Q4 2022. However, the growth 
momentum is likely to be slow as the factor of 
China reopening has so far generated little 
demand growth. In our view, industrial players will 
shift their focus to grow volume instead of passing 
on increases in cost as inflation cools down. 
The Eurozone Manufacturing PMI for September 
stands at 43.4, which is little changed compared 
to the August level of 43.5. According to our 
findings, contractions in order book and an output 
decline trend is still ongoing. On the positive side, 
the price of input material has declined and 
manufacturers are passing the cost savings to 
their clients.
Due to the aircraft engine recall issues (PW1100G 
Geared Turbofan Engines), we are now neutral on 
Aerospace & Defense from positive previously. We also lowered our opinion to neutral for Airlines. 
Although airlines players will likely benefit from 
the global aviation sector recovery due to 
Covid-19 normalization, its margin could be 
affected by the spike in jet fuel price (in line 
with the higher crude oil price). 
We are positive on the Industrial Machinery and 
Industrial Conglomerates sub-sectors. 
Industrial Machinery sub-sector players are the 
beneficiaries of high demand due to energy 
efficiency and automation. For Industrial 
Conglomerates, strong demand for 
electrification and sustainability services 
should continue to support revenue growth.
The focus for Trading Companies and 
Distributors will be to reduce the record-high 
inventory in the near term, in our view. This 
may affect their near-term margin, although it 
could lead to stronger cash flow. For the Heavy 
Electrical Equipment sub-sector, the smoother 
supply chain should lead to improvement in 
revenue recognition. However, the intense 
competition should keep the margin upside 
limited.
We are less positive on the Building Products 
and Construction Machinery & Heavy Trucks 
sub-sectors. We expect the Building Products 
sub-sector’s revenue to be affected by poor 
demand for property during slow economy 
growth/recession in Europe. For the 
Construction Machinery & Heavy Trucks sub-
sector, slower economy growth/recession in 
Europe should affect construction activity, 
trucks demand, and rolling stock.

customer is particularly susceptible to weak 
economic conditions. We’re currently seeing 
DG’s core customer pull back on discretionary 
spending, a trend that has recently been 
amplified by the conclusion of SNAP emergency 
allotments, lower tax refunds, and elevated food

uWe project 6.8% operating margins in FY 24,

discretionary items and skew to younger, 
wealthier, and more suburban shoppers.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uOur opinion is Buy, as we believe DG shares are 
attractively valued following the steep sell-off 
this year. FY 24/CY 23 has shaped up to be a 
challenging year, driven by weak consumer 
discretionary spending, excess inventory 
(resulting in more markdowns), retail theft, and 
heavy investments in store labor. We see FY 25/
CY 24 being a stronger year, as various 
transitory headwinds should abate (e.g., shrink, 
markdowns), while comp sales should 
strengthen alongside improving store traffic 
trends. Longer term, we see plenty of unit 
growth runway in the U.S. and abroad (e.g., 
Mexico) and believe DG can create sustainable 
competitive advantages as it executes on 
various initiatives (e.g., pOpshelf, DG Fresh, DG

forecast 14% EPS growth in FY 25 to $9.20 
(consensus is $8.92).","Industry Outlook
CFRA’s 12-month fundamental outlook for the 
Consumer Staples Merchandise Retail sub-
industry is neutral. On the positive side, we see the 
sub-industry benefiting from consumers shopping 
closer to home and seeking value amid inflationary 
pressures. We are also bullish on the sub-
industry’s evolution beyond core retail, including 
expansion into higher-margin service streams 
(e.g., advertising, fulfillment, subscriptions, data 
monetization). Our view is tempered by ongoing 
wage pressures, lingering inventory issues 
(including a recent uptick in theft and organized 
crime), intensifying promotions/discounts, and 
weaker consumer spending within more 
discretionary categories (e.g., apparel, electronics, 
home goods, etc.).
The sub-industry prides itself on strong value 
offerings and price gaps relative to other retailers, 
particularly retailers like Walmart, Costco, and 
Target. These retailers also act as a one-stop shop 
for consumers given the depth and breadth of 
products and services offered, and are also 
conveniently located close to the consumer. For 
example, approximately 90% of the U.S. 
population lives within 10 miles of a Walmart 
store. Lastly, many of these retailers also have 
discounted fuel stations (e.g., Walmart and 
Costco), which will be another tailwind for store 
foot traffic given inflationary pressures on 
consumer budgets. We expect to see strong 
transaction growth and foot traffic in 2023.
The sub-industry is currently facing headwinds 
from a shift in consumer spending to 
consumables and away from discretionary 
products. This is creating gross margin pressure 
because discretionary products are typically high-
margin sales versus consumables like grocery, 
which are typically low-margin sales. This shift in 
consumer spending has also created some excess 
inventory issues, forcing some retailers to offer 
steep price discounts and hold back on placing 
more orders until they have cleared the unwanted 
stock. We expect an intensive promotional 
environment in 2023, which could be another 
gross margin headwind.Higher prices carried the top line for the sub-
industry throughout 2022. In 2023, we don’t 
expect to see as much of a benefit from higher 
prices as comparable figures get tough and the 
industry pushes more promotions and 
discounts to consumers. Also, if inflationary 
pressures ease, we could start to see retailers 
start cutting prices to remain competitive, 
which could be a sales headwind unless the 
financial impact is more than offset by 
stronger transaction/volume growth.
One major tailwind in 2023 could be lower 
supply chain costs, particularly when it comes 
to ocean freight and domestic transportation. 
The global economy is now facing too many 
shipping containers, a stark difference from 
the past few years when there was a massive 
shortage of containers. The result is plunging 
oversea freight rates, which is a positive for the 
sub-industry given the sheer amount of goods 
they import. We should also see domestic 
transportation rates come down as a result of 
weakening demand and increased capacity.

EQUITY Factsheet_ Equinor ASA,"Highlights
uEquinor’s Q2 2023 adjusted net income of 
USD2.25 billion (-57% Y/Y; -36% Q/Q) was 
within expectations. The earnings decline was 
due to lower energy price realizations, 
specifically its Q2 2023 E&P Norway average 
internal gas price weakened to USD10.2/mmtu 
versus USD25.5/mmtu in Q2 2022 and USD17.4 
in Q1 2023. Net debt-to-capital employed 
increased in Q2 2023 to -35%  (-52% as of Mar-
2023) owing to unfavorable tax phasing totaling 
~USD10 billion and high capital distribution.
uLNG prices have retraced significantly, Dutch 
TTF fell below EUR30/MWh (2022: EUR131/
MWh) and Henry Hub dropped below USD2/
mmtu (2022: USD6.54/mmbtu) before paring 
some losses amid summer. Moreover, we think 
high energy storage levels in European nations 
and an increasing risk of storage congestion 
may reduce the level of anticipated gas price 
increase during 2023/2024 winter, thus putting 
further downside pressure on Equinor’s 
profitability in 2023. Operationally, we estimate 
Equinor to raise its hydrocarbon production by 
around 3% in 2023, supported by new fields 
from Johan Sverdrup Phase 2 and Njord on 
stream, alongside production ramp-up from 
Peregrino fields.
uWe forecast EPS of USD4.70 for both 2023 and 
2024.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uOur call is 2-STARS (Sell). As the largest gas 
supplier in Europe with nearly 40% of 
hydrocarbon output being contributed by 
indigenous gas production, Equinor is uniquely 
positioned to support the energy transition of 
European nations which are focused on seeking 
alternative sources of fossil fuels to reduce 
energy dependency on Russia. However, LNG 
prices have retraced significantly, resulting in 
EPS headwinds versus the high base in 2022. 
We think the high level of energy storage across 
European nations (that we believe may be full by 
the end-Q3 2023) will avert the fear of an 
energy crisis during 2023/2024 winter. Such 
development will reduce the level of anticipated 
gas prices ahead of winter and lower Equinor’s 
profitability, in our view. Also, we think the 
planned capital distribution in 2023 is arguably 
backward-looking and unsustainable.
uUpside risks that may prompt us to raise our 
recommendation and/or target price include 
increase in oil and gas prices and potential 
value crystallization from assets spin-off. 
uOur 12-month target price for Equinor is 
NOK260, reflecting a P/NAV of 1.6x, a premium 
to peer average P/NAV of 1.2x, justified in our 
view by Equinor’s superior ROE profile.","Industry Outlook
Following the outperformance of European Energy 
sector in 2022 (EMEA Energy up 32% versus S&P 
350 down 12%), the sector was largely flat in 2023 
(YTD August), underperforming S&P 350, which 
was up 10%. Consequently, the Energy sector PE 
multiple versus S&P 350 has widened and is now 
at close to a 50% discount, approaching the lower 
end of its historical discount against S&P350 of 
50-60%. We think the current discount is 
becoming more reasonable, but weak global 
economic activities deter us from turning fully 
positive on the EMEA Energy sector, therefore 
maintaining our opinion of Market Weight for 
European Energy.
World oil supply growth is expected to slow to 1.4 
million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2023 versus 4.7 
mb/d growth in 2022, according to International 
Energy Agency (IEA), as production expansion 
from Non-Opec+ (i.e., U.S. and Brazil) will be 
partially offset by a production cut by OPEC+. 
OPEC+ cut its crude oil production to a near two-
year low in July 2023 as a major voluntary cut by 
Saudi Arabia took effect. The voluntary cut is 
expected to continue till September 2023 and to 
be extended if necessary. 
According to IEA, oil demand in 2023 is set to rise 
by 2.2 mb/d to a record high of 102.1 mb/d, 
surpassing the pre-pandemic level. The rise in 
demand is expected to be led by the gain from 
non-OECD countries, specifically China, rather 
than OECD countries. Therefore, we think there 
may be a risk for the strong demand forecast to 
fall through, given that China’s recovery appears to 
be lackluster with multiple GDP forecast 
downgrades following its release of Q2 2023 
economic data. Meanwhile, the global oil 
inventories have grown steadily in H1 2023, easing 
the tremendous tightness felt by the industry 
previously. 
As we access the supply and demand holistically, 
we think the additional OPEC+ cut in H2 2023 may 
result in increasing draws in inventories and oil on 
water, thus limiting further build-up whilst 
introducing renewed volatility to the market. As of 
August 2023, EIA forecasts Brent crude oil prices averaging USD82/barrel in 2023 and USD86/
barrel in 2024. Although the forecasts may not 
be as robust as 2022’s USD101/barrel, the 
gradual improvement versus its previous May 
2023 forecast of USD79/barrel in 2023 and 
USD74/barrel in 2024 certainly signals rowing 
optimism in oil prices, in our view.
Overall, we expect that integrated oil players, 
particularly those that have a dominant 
contribution from exploration and production 
will generate lower earnings in 2023 because 
the negative pricing effect will likely offset any 
small increase in volumes. Also, significantly 
lower refining margins will drag the earnings of 
integrated oil players. Cash yield to 
shareholders is expected to be substantial in 
2023, but we think it may experience a steep 
step-down in 2024 as free cash flow drops and 
companies become more leveraged.
Meanwhile, we remain more positive on the 
energy equipment and service providers after a 
transition year in 2022, where they executed 
contracts won during the prior trough period, 
which in our view, generated lower margins. We 
believe their improving order books with 
favorable pricing and payment terms alongside 
stronger tender pipelines are likely to boost 
2023 earnings. Furthermore, we believe they 
will be catalyzed by the reduced availability of 
energy and service providers alongside growth 
in the offshore renewable space.

Our sector recommendation for EMEA Health Care 
is Overweight. Year-to-date through May 30, 2023, 
the S&P Europe 350 Health Care Index slightly 
outperformed the market (+6.8% vs. a 6.6% 
increase in the broader S&P Europe 350 Index), 
led by the Healthcare Equipment & Services sub-
sector. The sector is trading at ~17x 2023 P/E, at 
the upper end of the historical average range of 
16x-17x, which is still decent in our view 
considering the higher EPS growth as compared to 
the market (S&P Capital IQ consensus estimates: 
2023 EPS growth of 6.4% vs +0.3% for S&P Euro 
350; 2024 EPS growth of 12.3% vs +6.9% for S&P 
Euro 350). We see demand for health care to be 
generally resilient in the event of worsening 
macroeconomy. We expect volume growth and 
cost savings to drive the sector earnings, partly 
offset by continued pricing pressure, lower 
contribution from Covid-19-related sales, and 
overall cost inflation. 
For the Pharmaceutical, Biotechnology, and Life 
Science sub-sector, we expect the rollout of new 
launches and core products to be the key growth 
drivers, providing some cushion to the lower 
Covid-19-related sales. Among the biggest 
potential launches of 2023 include Roche’s gene 
therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, GSK’s 
vaccine for older adults against RSV, and AbbVie/
Genmab’s epcoritamab. Within our coverage, Novo 
Nordisk tops the sales and core EPS growth 
forecasts for 2023, boosted by the strong demand 
for its GLP-1 based diabetes and obesity 
treatments. At the opposite end, we see lower 
year-over-year earnings in 2023 for Roche (lower 
Covid-19-related sales) and Bayer (weaker Crop 
Science division due to the softening glyphosate 
prices and continued pricing pressure in 
pharmaceutical division). We also expect the 
ongoing efficiency program to help counter cost 
inflation. The majority of European pharmaceutical 
companies managed to record margin expansion 
on better efficiency as well as better product mix 
(e.g., stronger growth in the high-margin 
oncology/specialty care segments) in 2022 as well 
as in the March 2023 quarter. For the Healthcare Equipment & Services sub-
sector, we see easing headwinds with the 
combination of subsiding supply chain 
constraints, moderating energy prices, and the 
reopening of China creating room for demand 
recovery and margin improvement in 2023. 
That said, we are mindful of the wage inflation 
and pricing pressure from the implementation 
of the volume-based procurement program 
(VBP) in China. Most companies posted better 
sales in the March 2023 quarter on improved 
demand and better market conditions, but 
margins were mixed as not all companies 
under our coverage managed to offset cost 
inflation with efficiency and/or cost savings.

EQUITY Factsheet_ Fortis Inc.,"Highlights
uWe expect revenue will grow near 4.5%-5.0% in 
2023, followed by 3.0%-3.5%  growth in 2024. 
Revenue increased nearly 17% in 2022, 
supported by retail electric sales growth in 
several service territories, as well as favorable 
FX. We expect rate updates at Fortis Alberta and 
TEP (Arizona) to support revenues, offset by 
less favorable first half weather. 
uWe anticipate an EBIT margin near 26.5% in 
2023 and 26.5%-27.0% in 2024, compared to 
24.8% in 2022. We attribute 2022’s declining 
margin to sales growth outpacing profit growth, 
somewhat driven by inflation in operations and 
maintenance costs. We expect rate increases 
and returns on capital investments to support 
margin growth, offset by higher depreciation 
costs. 
uFTS’s 2024-2028 capex plan of $25.0B has 
around 27% spending targeted at clean energy. 
FTS has shown strong execution thus far on its 
goal of reducing Scope 1 carbon emissions 75% 
by 2035 (based on 2019 levels), with a 28% 
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 
2019-2022. Much of FTS’s planned investment 
in wind, solar, and energy storage in Arizona is 
not expected to occur until the latter half of the 
decade, however. FTS plans for coal-free 
operations by 2032.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uShares recently traded roughly 11% above the 
peer median (based on 2024 consensus EPS), 
and our Sell opinion reflects our view that FTS 
does not merit its historical peer premium given 
slower near-term EPS and dividend growth 
expectations. On a three-year (2023-2026) 
CAGR basis, we expect EPS growth near 5.1%, 
below the recent 6.4% median for S&P 1500 
electric utilities, while we expect dividend 
growth near 4.8% vs. the peer median of 5.7%. 
FTS recently received a final order in the TEP 
(AZ) electric rate case and will see a $100M rate 
increase (about 43% of the original request) 
with a 9.55% authorized ROE (vs. the 10.25% 
original request). We see this as an average 
outcome in the current utility regulatory 
environment. Shares recently yielded 4.3%, in 
line with the peer median. 
uRisks to our recommendation and target price 
include more constructive regulatory outcomes 
and strengthening economic conditions in FTS’s 
service territories within the U.S. and Canada.
uOur 12-month target of CAD55 is 17.7x our 
2024 EPS estimate, a discount to FTS’s five-
year historical average, reflecting somewhat 
weaker near-term EPS and dividend growth 
trajectories compared to peers, in our view.","Industry Outlook
Our 12-month fundamental outlook for electric 
utilities is neutral. We see U.S. retail electric 
demand growing slowly over the near term, with 
the higher interest rate environment posing 
headwinds for industrial production and new 
housing. Although they do not expect a recession, 
Action Economics forecasts an  increase in 
unemployment levels in both 2023 and 2024, 
which can lead to lower power demand across the 
residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. In 
the first half of 2023, we saw milder temperatures 
negatively impact many utilities by lowering power 
demand, though the U.S. Energy Information 
Administration (EIA) forecasts imply more 
favorable weather trends in 2024 with higher U.S. 
average cooling degree days and heating degree 
days. EIA data forecasts a near 1.5% decline in 
retail electricity sales (in billions of kilowatthours) 
during 2023 before  sales recover by around 2.1% 
in 2024. We think these factors support the 
conservative guidance for electric load growth 
recently provided by many utilities.
We expect some operating headwinds to 
moderate in the near term. Operations and 
maintenance expenses significantly increased for  
utilities due to recent inflation in labor and supply 
costs. With  utilities typically maintaining average 
total debt to capitalization levels near 60%, the 
industry saw increased borrowing costs and higher 
interest expenses as a result of the recent rise in 
interest rates. However, recent quarterly results 
indicate that many  utilities are seeing falling 
operations and maintenance costs relative to 
2022 levels, with many companies heightening 
their focus on operating efficiency and cost 
controls. Many market participants expect that the 
rising interest rate environment will soon come to 
an end, which we think would benefit the sector. 
On the regulatory front, we continue to see some 
strictness in  utility rate cases. When looking at 
electric rate cases, authorized return on equity 
(ROE), a key driver of utility earnings, appears to 
be stagnant thus far in 2023. Regulatory Research 
Associates electric rate case data through August 
20, 2023 showed average authorized ROE of 9.54%, flat with the 2022 full-year average. We 
expect tight regulatory conditions to continue 
in the near term and anticipate largely neutral 
or moderately-constructive outcomes, though 
we are cautious about upcoming decisions in 
more challenging jurisdictions such as Arizona. 
We expect positive earnings contributions from 
record levels of capital investment, including 
electric and gas infrastructure upgrades and 
clean power generation such as wind, solar, 
and battery storage. Capital spending expands 
utility rate bases, typically leading to rate 
increases and providing utilities opportunities 
to utilize tax incentives for clean energy 
investments, which were extended under the 
Inflation Reduction Act. Capital spending 
increased around 8.6% for electric utilities 
during 2022, reaching an all-time high of $96.8 
billion for the sub-industry. We currently expect 
sub-industry capital spending of $101.8 billion 
in 2023 (+5.2%), followed by $108.1 billion in 
2024 (+6.2%). 
Year-to-date through August 18, the S&P 1500 
Electric Utilities Index fell 10.9% versus an 
11.1% decrease in the S&P 1500 Utilities Index 
and a 13.1% increase in the S&P Composite 
1500 Index. The sub-industry fell 0.7% in 2022, 
while the S&P 1500 Utilities Index fell 1.6%, 
and the S&P Composite 1500 declined 19.1%.

well as the easing of labor shortage in the U.S. 
(which, along with the impact of Covid-19 on 
treatment volumes, hit FME’s results and led to 
multiple profit warnings and medium-term

improvement for the company in 2023 and

time high of EUR21.1 billion. We see more 
challenges to volume in 2023 as energy and raw 
material prices remain volatile, leading to 
unpredictable activity in the construction 
industry. H1 2023 revenues were up 8.5% to 
EUR10,473 million, driven largely by price 
adjustments in all business areas. Revenue 
grew in all operating regions on a LFL basis in 
Q2 2023 but at a slower pace vs. the double-
digit growth in Q1 2023.
uHEI’s H1 2023 EBITDA increased to EUR1,787 
million (+21.3% LFL) as continuous cost 
management and the easing of energy and raw 
material costs improved profitability in an 
environment of high inflation and increasing 
interest rates which has led to a drop in 
construction activity, particularly in residential 
construction. This led to a 31% LFL EBIT 
increase to EUR1,189 million, better than 
expected. For 2023, HEI is guiding for EBIT 
between EUR2.7 billion and EUR2.9 billion, from 
the previous guidance of between EUR2.50 
billion and EUR2.65 billion previously.
uOur 2023 EPS estimate is EUR9.50 (from 
EUR9.00) and 2024 EPS estimate is EUR10.00 
(from EUR9.30).","Investment Rationale/Risk
uOur call is 4-STARS (Buy). The rapid spread of 
Covid-19 created near-term uncertainty for HEI, 
which saw some construction projects being 
put on hold in the major parts of its key 
markets. HEI experienced a severe volume drop 
in several countries from mid-March onwards, 
with significant demand decline in Italy, India, 
Malaysia, and Bangladesh. HEI’s net debt as of 
end-Jun 2023 amounted to EUR6.7 billion, 
down about EUR100 million Y/Y. After a strong 
recovery in 2021 and 2022, HEI managed to 
maintain strong momentum going into 2023 
despite an uncertain macroeconomic situation. 
We see some long-term benefits from HEI’s 
cost savings and remain positive as HEI 
continues to perform amidst wider macro 
uncertainties. 
uDownside risks include weaker infrastructure 
spending in key markets, increasing geopolitical 
tensions, and prolonged adverse weather 
conditions.
uOur 12-month target price of EUR83 implies a 
2023 P/E of 8.7x, a level where it has been 
trading between 2018 to 2021, as we think the 
strong recovery story is offset by the threat of 
macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties.","Industry Outlook
We have an underweight view on EMEA Materials 
as industries face the effects of high interest rates 
and slower macroeconomic development in 2023. 
This follows the period of high inflation in 2022, 
though the Materials companies themselves have 
been able to pass on high cost prices down the 
supply chain. Prices have eased in 2023 as we 
expected, but volumes are not recovering as 
quickly due to the weaker macroeconomic 
conditions. For the end of 2023, we see some 
increase in prices, though volumes will remain 
lower.
The S&P Europe 350 Materials Index has 
underperformed the market in 2023 up to August 
2023, down 0.9% vs. an 8.2% increase in the 
broader S&P Europe 350 Index during the same 
period. 
For the Metals & Mining sub-sector, the growing 
concern over global economic growth remains a 
key risk to earnings in the short-term in our view – 
Global Copper Users PMI and Global Steel Users 
PMI improved slightly in August vs. July. However, 
this was solely driven by Asia as the U.S. saw a 
renewed deterioration in operating conditions 
while Europe declined further. We note 
ArcelorMittal (one of the largest steel producers) 
also lowered its forecast for global ex-China 
apparent steel demand growth in July to reflect 
the weaknesses in the U.S. and Europe markets 
(weakness in long products demand due to weak 
construction activity). 
For the Construction Materials sub-sector, we 
expect growth to continue to be supported by 
infrastructure spending in the U.S. and, to a lesser 
extent, in Europe. However, other segments of 
construction will continue to be weak, as evident 
by the Eurozone construction PMI not having been 
in expansionary territory since April 2022. The 
weaker macroeconomic conditions make further 
recovery more questionable, in our opinion. 
For the Chemical sub-sector, we continue to see 
growth recovery, particularly for the companies 
that are exposed to industries that have 
undergone major destocking in 2022, as volume 
growth outweighs pricing declines. Overall, we are underweight on the industry due 
to the weaker macroeconomic condition 
despite the breadth of its end markets.

uWe forecast revenue reaching $9.9B in 2023 
and $10.8B in 2024, following a 259% increase 
to $8.8B in 2022 due to the rebound from 
pandemic-related disruptions. We expect a 
continued growth in revenue per available room 
(RevPAR) across  geographical regions, with 
Asia-Pacific and Europe  leading the way, 
followed by North America to a lesser extent. 
Additionally, we note management’s guidance of 
system-wide RevPAR growth of 10%-12% and 
new unit growth of approximately 5%, along 
with a strategic focus on growing fee-based 
revenues and capturing market share in the 
low- to mid-priced hotel segments within the 
U.S. HLT’s customer loyalty program (HHonors) 
also continues to demonstrate robust growth 
(+20% Y/Y) surpassing 165M members in Q2 
2023. 
uWe project an adusted EBITDA margin of 67.8% 
in 2023, a modest decline from 68.9% in 2022, 
mainly due to persistent inflationary pressures, 
primarily labor costs, partially offset by robust 
top-line growth. We also expect new unit growth 
in the 5.0%-5.5% range in 2023, following HLT’s 
addition of 23,200 rooms in 1H 2023.
uAfter depreciation and amortization, as well as 
interest expense and taxes, we project EPS of 
$6.00 in 2023 and $6.65 in 2024.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uOur Buy rating reflects what we view as an 
attractive valuation on the shares and potential 
improvement in fundamentals. While we expect  
a revenue growth slowdown in 2H 2023, we 
think the deceleration will be smaller than 
consensus estimates. Despite HLT's slightly 
lower guidance on 2023 net rooms growth to 
around 5% vs. a 5.25% midpoint, we also think a 
reacceleration to 6%-7% post-2024 is 
achievable. This view is bolstered by HLT’s plans  
to gain share in the low- to mid-priced tier hotel 
segments in the U.S. with a focus on hotel 
conversions. Over time, this should boost HLT’s 
margins and have network effects by growing  
loyalty members in younger age cohorts who 
tend to value travel more.
uRisks to our recommendation and target price 
include 1) a recession or decline in travel-
related  spending,  2) higher  competition from  
alternative accommodations (i.e., Airbnb), and 
3) a slow recovery in China.
uOn July 26, we lifted our 12-month target by $8 
to $165 on a 2024 EV/EBITDA of 16.0x, a 
discount to HLT's five-year average forward EV/
EBITDA of 22.4x, justified by the risk of slower 
net rooms growth and recession. In Q2, HLT 
returned $510M to shareholders ($470M in 
buybacks and $40M in dividends).","Industry Outlook
We are neutral on the hotels, resorts, and cruise 
lines subindustry, which has continued to 
demonstrate strong demand following the 
pandemic, especially in the leisure sector. 
However, as we look ahead, we anticipate a 
moderation in revenue growth during the latter 
half of 2023 and early 2024. This forecast factors 
in seasonality, the influence of increased pricing 
on consumer spending, and a slower-than-
expected recovery in business travel and the China 
market post their “Zero-Covid” policy. Moreover, 
certain companies might encounter unanticipated 
margin pressures due to elevated labor costs.
The global hospitality industry includes the major 
operators of hotel chains, vacation ownership 
(timeshare) businesses, and alternative 
accommodations. Even in the face of an uncertain 
macroeconomic climate, the global hospitality 
industry has continued to demonstrate its 
resilience and potential for secular growth 
following the pandemic. In our view, this is largely 
due to the shift in consumer spending towards 
experiential purchases such as travel, which has 
been better than expected. As a result, we expect 
the industry to post positive revenue growth 
annually and sequentially, though the year-over-
year growth rate is likely to slow as the industry 
transitions beyond its post-pandemic recovery 
phase. The industry is also likely to continue 
benefiting from strong demand for leisure and 
group travel, while the revival of business travel is 
anticipated to contribute, albeit at a slower pace 
and still lagging pre-pandemic occupancy levels. 
Nonetheless, we expect some travel-related 
companies will confront hurdles. Companies with 
exposure to the Chinese market may grapple with 
challenges due to recent issues in their property 
sector and international travel demand. In terms 
of profit margins, we project most companies will 
see inflationary pressures moderate. Yet, we also 
anticipate some companies may face slower-
than-anticipated declines in specific costs, 
especially related to labor. 
Hotel operators also continue to grapple with 
construction difficulties, resulting in an increase in asset recycling and mergers and acquisitions 
to drive supply growth. This is largely due to 
tougher financial conditions for developers, 
permitting delays, and elevated costs. 
Consequently, alongside changes in post-
pandemic travel trends, extended-stay hotels 
have garnered more new development in the 
U.S., accounting for roughly 30% of planned 
rooms. In addition, interest in alternative 
accommodation options, such as Airbnb and 
Vrbo, could intensify competition for traditional 
hotel operators, especially as travelers 
increasingly opt for longer stays. 
Separately, cruise line operators have 
continued to see strong consumer demand, 
leading us to project occupancy rates 
exceeding 100% for the year. However, heading 
into late 2023 and early 2024, the threat of 
recession still looms, especially considering 
cruise line operators’ high debt levels. 
Furthermore, potential risks, including a 
slowdown in booking trends, rising interest 
rates, and lingering inflationary pressures, 
persist.
Through July 7, 2023, the S&P 1500 Hotels, 
Resorts & Cruise Lines Index grew 33.6% vs.

EQUITY Factsheet_ Intercontinental Exchange Inc.,"Highlights
uWe see organic revenue growth of 4%-6% in 
2023 as ICE’s recurring revenue (about half of 
total revenue) continues its momentum. We 
expect sequential quarterly growth in upcoming 
quarters to be aided by a rebound in Mortgage 
Technology transactional revenue. In Q1, this 
transactional revenue was down 53% Y/Y as 
mortgage rates remained elevated. This revenue 
then rebounded 20% sequentially in Q2, but 
remained more than 60% below 2021 levels. 
Looking forward, we expect more stable 
mortgage rates (perhaps even falling in 2024) 
to lead to an uptick in activity and strong growth 
in mortgage revenue. 
uDespite continued mortgage headwinds, we 
were impressed by ICE’s adjusted operating 
margin of 60.0% (+80 bps Y/Y) in Q2 as 
adjusted expenses rose just 2%. Looking at full-
year 2023, we see expansion over 2022’s 
operating margin of 59% and expect an 
operating margin of 60% as revenue growth 
outpaces higher employee and technology 
spend. 
uOn September 5, 2023, ICE closed its 
acquisition of Black Knight for $11.9 billion. In 
order to get the deal done, the two companies  
agreed to sell Black Knight's  Optimal Blue 
business to Constellation Software for $700 
million. ","Investment Rationale/Risk
uIn a world full of uncertainty, we view shares of 
ICE favorably as the company has an 
unprecedented ability to perform in all market 
environments. Not only was ICE able to grow 
earnings before, during, and after the pandemic, 
but ICE has seen earnings growth in each year 
since it went public in 2005. Furthermore, we 
forecast its mortgage technology business will 
continue to gain market share and create 
cross-sell opportunities. With the  acquisition of 
Black Knight, ICE has the opportunity to take a 
stranglehold on the industry by offering both 
standardized and customized products to its 
customers. Additionally, we are encouraged by 
ICE’s recurring revenue growth, which decreases 
the firm’s reliance on trading volumes. 
uRisks to our recommendation and target price 
include greater-than-expected competition or 
weakening in the derivative markets, a 
significant decline in trading volumes, tighter 
regulatory guidelines that may limit data pricing 
power, and a slowing global economy. 
uOn August 3, we increased our 12-month target 
price by $5 to $135, reflecting a P/E of 21.8x our 
2024 EPS estimate, in line with ICE’s 10-year 
average of 21.4x. ","Industry Outlook
We have a positive fundamental outlook on the 
Financial Exchanges & Data sub-industry for the 
next 12 months. 
As a group, the major U.S. exchanges have grown 
EPS at nearly double the speed of the S&P 500 
over last decade and impressively, were able to 
grow before, during, and after the pandemic. With 
rapid innovation in the exchange space, we expect 
most exchanges to continue to grow EPS at high-
single digits as they continue to judiciously meet 
client needs with new products and services.
We believe a side effect of recent bank failures 
could be increased derivative activity. CME’s CEO, 
Terrence Duffy, is known for stating that clients 
need to manage risk before shocks occur, not 
after the shock has already occurred. Given the 
collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and increased 
scrutiny on interest rate exposure, we expect bank 
executives to lean more heavily on exchange-
traded products like swaps or futures to manage 
their risk. Until recently, this risk was largely 
unhedged as a decade-plus of low interest rates 
led banking teams to prioritize credit risk over 
interest rate risk. However, we expect the use of 
these products to increase materially, and we note 
the banking industry has enormous exposure with 
total assets of nearly $23 trillion.
Data providers, largely the rating agencies, have 
struggled over the last year and a half as 
geopolitical uncertainty, slow economic growth, 
and a hawkish Federal Reserve have severely 
impacted debt issuance volumes. Many 
corporations came into this period from a position 
of power as they pulled forward debt issuance in 
2020 and 2021 to take advantage of historically 
low interest rates. As a result, corporations have 
sat on the sidelines when possible, resulting in 
corporate debt-to-GDP levels falling from a high of 
57% in the second quarter of 2020 to under 49% 
as of the second quarter of 2023. However, we see 
2022 and early 2023 as a low watermark for debt 
issuance and expect issuance levels to rise into 
2024 as the uncertainty of 2022 and early 2023 
moderates. We see issuance momentum 
continuing through 2025 as a growing level of corporate-rated debt matures and needs to be 
replaced. As a result, we expect credit rating 
agencies to see improving performance as 
cost-cutting measures are met with improving 
debt issuance conditions. An added benefit 
should come from the analytics businesses, 
which help smooth out transaction-related 
revenues, given the acyclical nature of 
analytics revenue. 
We see index providers as well positioned over 
the long term as we expect growth to generally 
outpace the overall market as index providers 
continue to benefit from the slow move of 
funds from active to passive. Looking over the 
next 12 months, we expect revenue exposure 
to indices to turn from a headwind to a tailwind 
as weak comps lead to outsized growth in 
upcoming quarters. 
YTD as of September 22, the Financial 
Exchanges & Data sub-industry was up 10.2%

EQUITY Factsheet_ Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A.,"Highlights
uIntesa Sanpaolo’s (ISP) Q2 2023 net income 
surged 74% Y/Y to EUR2.27 bln, comfortably 
beating S&P Capital IQ consensus estimate of 
EUR1.86 bln. The result was driven by higher 
revenues (+19%), as net interest income 
increased by 71% to EUR3.6 bln, and a decline 
in loan loss provisions to EUR367 mln from 
EUR730 mln, benefiting from recoveries relating 
to exposure to Russia and Ukraine. We see 
consensus upgrades ahead following ISP’s 
upward revision in its 2023 guidance, now 
expecting net income of well above EUR7 bln 
(~EUR7 bln previously).
uFor 2023, we expect ISP’s net interest income 
will be boosted by the higher interest rate 
environment in Europe. We expect its fee and 
commission income to show a comeback amid 
potential market recovery. Despite the 
inflationary environment, we think ISP should be 
able to keep operating costs in check due to 
past efforts to reduce cost and increase 
operating efficiency. Loan loss provisions will 
most likely edge higher due to increasing macro 
uncertainty, but we believe this will still be at a 
manageable level, given ISP’s improving asset 
quality.
uWe raise our EPS forecasts to EUR0.40 (EUR.36) 
for 2023 and EUR0.41 (EUR0.38) for 2024.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uOur recommendation is 4-STARS (Buy). We 
remain positive on ISP’s outlook despite risk of 
deterioration of the Italian economy given 
interest rate tailwinds, ISP’s strong cost control, 
and its improving asset quality (i.e., declining 
NPL ratio and NPL stock). ISP unveiled an 
ambitious 2022-2025 Business Plan, aiming to 
add EUR2.3 billion in profits by 2025, which we 
think the company can exceed given the boost 
from rising interest rates. This will be 
supplemented by net commission and fee 
income from the insurance business, 
accounting for 57% of ISP’s operating income 
by 2025, up from 54% in 2021. ISP’s capital 
return ability remains top of class, with an 
estimated dividend yield ~11.0% in 2023 (vs. 
peer average of ~7%) and a EUR22 billion 
capital distribution target that is on track, with 
potential upside, in our view. 
uKey downside risks include major economic 
slowdown or prolonged recession in key 
markets, deterioration in asset quality, and 
failure to deliver financial targets under its 
business plan.
uWe raise our 12-month target price for ISP to 
EUR3.00 (EUR2.80), reflecting a P/B of 0.84x, 
above its 5-year average P/B of 0.64x, justified 
in our view by the higher interest rate 
environment.","Industry Outlook
Our fundamental outlook on EMEA Financials for 
the next 12 months is neutral. We believe the 
industry in general will benefit from the higher 
interest rate environment. This is balanced by 
growing concerns about the economy, including 
slower growth and persistent inflation.
Year-to-date through 30 September 2023, the 
S&P Europe 350 Financials Index was up 9.2%, 
outperforming the broader market, represented by 
the S&P Europe 350 Index, which recorded a gain 
of 6.5% during the same period.
For the bank sub-industry, we have a neutral view. 
Signs of easing interest rate tailwind have 
gathered momentum even as the European 
Central Bank (ECB) raised its interest rate for the 
10th consecutive time in September 2023 by 
another 0.25%-pts to an all-time high of 4.0%. 
The ECB has signaled its intention to keep rates on 
hold in the future. That said, we still expect banks 
to see expanding net interest income and net 
interest margins in H2 2023. We expect this to 
normalize in 2024 due to rising pass-through 
rates, a gradual decline in sector-wide customer 
deposits, peaking policy rates, slower loans 
growth, and weaker macroeconomic prospects. 
We see higher operating expenses driven by wages 
and general inflation, IT, and compliance. We 
expect rising loan loss provisions in the coming 
months as consumers and businesses will start to 
feel the negative impact from higher interest rates 
and inflation.
Our fundamental outlook for the insurance sub-
industry is neutral. The challenge for life insurers 
in managing asset-liability and duration (given the 
long-term nature of policyholder obligations) 
caused by the rapid interest rate hikes should 
ease, in our view, as the uptrend in interest rates is 
likely to end in the near term. We expect improving 
investment yields to support the earnings of life 
insurers but are wary of slowing growth in gross 
written premiums amid our anticipated lackluster 
economic activities in Europe. For P&C insurers, 
we think profitability is set to improve amid our 
anticipation of easing heavy natural catastrophe 
claims that plagued most P&C insurers in recent years, moderated claim cost inflation, and firm 
pricing of new coverages. As for the reinsurers, 
consensus earnings expectations are 
becoming lofty, in our opinion, fully accounting 
for the benefit of the hardening market in the 
reinsurance segment. We note that the 
average projected shareholder cash yield of 
reinsurers is merely 5%, nearly half of the 
projected cash yield of the insurance sub-
industry.
We are also neutral on the asset management 
sub-industry, where we expect asset under 
management (AUM) growth to slow down amid 
macro uncertainties. Two of the main positive 
factors for AUM growth are new products and 
new geographic markets. Investments that 
have been made to target new sources of AUM 
in the retail space more efficiently and to 
attract new mandates (especially from 
institutional investors) by offering extended 
quantitative and big data solutions are also 
potential drivers for AUM growth, in our view. 
Despite relatively strong expectations for top-
line growth, fee income is expected to grow 
more slowly, which implies further falls in fee 
margin (as a percentage of AUM).

EQUITY Factsheet_ ITT Inc.,"Highlights
uWe see high-single-digit organic sales growth 
of ~7%  in ‘23, driven primarily by  pricing and 
volume gains, backed by demand for industrial 
pumps, OE brake pads, aerospace and defense 
components, and EV and medical connectors. 
We expect global OEM market share gains in the 
automotive friction and brake pads businesses 
as well as incremental benefits from 
acquisitions. We see momentum in aerospace 
demand ramping higher through ‘23, coinciding 
with strong global air travel. Oil & gas markets 
are expected to remain supportive and we see 
ITT continuing to diversify and broaden its 
energy exposure (i.e., hydrogen/LNG). ITT is 
investing in EVs and other technology to ensure 
it remains a market leader, which we see 
bearing fruit through sales and margin gains.
uWe expect adj-operating margin to rise 100 bps 
to 18.2% in ‘23. In our view, pricing benefits 
across ITT’s businesses, productivity 
improvements, and easing cost inflation will 
drive margins higher in ‘23.
uWe forecast FCF to rise to $400M in ‘23. We see 
capital investments continuing to be routed 
toward productivity enhancements and growth 
in EV market share over the coming quarters. In 
‘23, we expect M&A to take precedence over 
share buybacks.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uOur Buy opinion reflects our outlook for benefits 
from recent acquisitions, strength in ITT’s 
balance sheet, and exposure to recovering end 
markets. ITT is focusing on expansion of its OEM 
footprint in its Motion Tech segment, especially 
with global electric vehicle manufacturers. We 
are encouraged by the company’s electrified 
platform wins within the friction business and 
ITT’s progress towards gaining nearly 37% share 
of all global OE electrified vehicle volumes by 
2025. We expect Connect & Control Tech results 
to be supported by the continued recovery in 
commercial aerospace and accelerating 
demand for defense products. Headwinds from 
material cost inflation and supply chain 
disruptions persist, yet are expected to 
gradually ease through ‘23. We see additional 
pricing actions being implemented in ‘23, 
helping to offset persistent inflationary 
pressures. 
uKey risks to our rating and target include soft 
demand for brake pad components and shock 
absorbers, competitive price pressures, slower-
than-expected economic activity, and higher 
input cost inflation.
uOur 12-month target of $110 is 19.4x our ‘24 
EPS, near ITT’s five-year forward average.","Industry Outlook
Our 12-month fundamental investment outlook 
for the industrial machinery sub-industry is 
neutral, reflecting our outlook for moderating 
order growth as shipments and lead times 
improve, balanced by resiliency across a number 
of key end markets. In our view,  drivers of 
machinery demand will be the ramping of 
aerospace and defense production lines, and 
strength in domestic oil and gas drilling activity. 
We expect these positive demand drivers to be 
offset by a softening manufacturing sector amid 
broader macro uncertainty.
The U.S. manufacturing sector remains in 
contraction territory following 28 months of 
growth, driven in part by moderating new order 
rates. Despite the recent softening of demand 
within the manufacturing sector, industrial 
machinery backlogs remain well-above historical 
levels (July U.S. Census Release: up 1% Y/Y; up 
35% from February 2020). Several of the largest 
players within the sub-industry, including Parker-
Hannifin, Otis,  Ingersoll Rand, and Xylem, achieved 
sequential growth to already elevated backlogs 
during Q2. We anticipate backlogs being worked 
down as the year progresses on meaningful 
improvements in global supply chains and 
component availability. We see near-record 
backlogs providing a cushion amid a dynamic 
macro environment and supporting financial 
results over the coming quarters.
The U.S.’s large aerospace and defense 
manufacturing base is a key customer for the 
industrial machinery sub-industry, and we see 
these customers supporting order growth 
throughout 2023. Looking ahead, defense 
spending will likely be boosted in response to 
Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, while at the same time, 
U.S. air travel demand has been robust. These 
factors are pushing Boeing, Airbus, and the major 
U.S. defense firms to ramp up production lines, 
which, in turn, should lead to healthy order growth 
for the industrial machinery sub-industry out of 
this customer group.
Machinery demand is also being supported by oil 
and gas companies. As of September 1,  2023 (per Baker Hughes), global oil and gas drilling 
activity was up 3% Y/Y, reflecting increasing 
global energy demand and supportive oil and 
gas prices. We expect activity surrounding oil 
and gas drilling and refining to be relatively 
solid through 2023 as prices remain favorable. 
Both upstream and downstream oil and gas 
players rely on many types of machinery, and 
higher production volumes could be a tailwind 
for the industrial machinery sub-industry over 
the next year if demand remains resilient and 
prices stay elevated.
We believe easing inflationary pressures from 
energy and material costs could support 
bottom line expansion in 2023. In July 2023, 
the producer price index for electric power in 
the U.S. was down 40% Y/Y. The index for 
global metal prices was up 4% Y/Y but down 
23% from the 2022 peak. Easing cost inflation 
should lend to machinery customer profitability 
and support new equipment orders, though we 
see an uncertain macro backdrop being a 
limiting factor.
Year-to-date through August 31, the S&P 1500 
Industrial Machinery Index rose 20.2%, 
outperforming the S&P 1500 Industrials Index

EQUITY Factsheet_ Koninklijke Philips N.V. (1),"Highlights
uWe forecast Philips’ (PHIA) sales to grow by ~3% 
in 2023, mainly driven by its biggest segment, 
Diagnostic & Treatment (D&T). In Q2 2023, 
comparable sales grew 9% Y/Y, driven by all 
segments with D&T growing 12% on continued 
supply chain improvement while Personal 
Health segment returned to growth (improving 
sellout trends, although consumer demand 
remains subdued). PHIA raised its 2023 
comparable sales growth outlook in July 2023 
(following the Q2 result) to mid-single digit 
from low-single digit.
uWe forecast adjusted EBITA margin to improve 
to ~9% for 2023 from 7.4% in 2022, with the 
overall inflationary headwind being cushioned by 
productivity measures, largely in line with the 
guidance of at the upper end of the high-single-
digit range. Adjusted EBITA margin expanded 
4.9%-pts in Q2 2023 (H1: +3.7%-pts to 9.4%) 
as productivity and pricing mitigate the cost 
headwinds. According to PHIA, productivity 
measures (including reducing workforce – 
reduction of 6,600 roles as of H1 2023) 
delivered a total of EUR427 million in savings in 
H1 2023.
uWe forecast EPS to improve to EUR1.16 for 
2023 and EUR1.30 for 2024 on better sales and 
margin.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uOur call is 2-STARS (Sell). We view the improved 
conditions against a very difficult 2022, along 
with the announced actions to restore 
performance (e.g., strengthen supply chain 
reliability, providing room for recovery in 2023. 
Nevertheless, we continue to be cautious on the 
Respironics recall issue – ongoing investigation 
by the U.S. Department of Justice and 
discussions with the FDA regarding a proposed 
consent decree, where PHIA has not made any 
provisions in the accounts for these matters. 
While PHIA has reached an agreement to 
resolve all economic loss claims in the U.S. 
Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) related to 
Respironics recall, the agreement does not 
settle any personal injury or medical monitoring 
claims in the MDL; therefore, uncertainty 
remains in our view. A continued decline in order 
intake since Q3 2022, albeit from a higher base, 
also adds to uncertainty in our view, which could 
affect future sales growth.
uKey upside risks include better-than-expected 
order intake and better results from productivity 
measures.
uOur 12-month target price of EUR16 implies a 
2023 P/E of 14x, below its 3-year mean of 17x, 
justified in our view to reflect the uncertainties 
related to Respironics recall.","Industry Outlook
Our sector recommendation for EMEA Health Care 
is Overweight. Year-to-date through September 
30, 2023, the S&P Europe 350 Health Care Index 
was up 7.1%, outperforming the broader market 
(6.5% increase in the broader S&P Europe 350 
Index), led by the Pharmaceutical, Biotechnology, 
and Life Science sub-sector. The sector is trading 
at ~16x 2024 P/E, within historical average range 
of 16x-17x, which is still decent in our view 
considering the higher EPS growth as compared to 
the market (S&P Capital IQ consensus estimates: 
2023 EPS growth of 4.3% vs. -0.4% for S&P Euro 
350; 2024 EPS growth of 12.0% vs. +6.4% for S&P 
Euro 350). We see demand for health care to be 
generally resilient in the event of worsening 
macroeconomy. We expect volume growth and 
cost savings to drive the sector earnings, partly 
offset by continued pricing pressure, lower 
contribution from Covid-19-related sales, and 
overall cost inflation. 
For the Pharmaceutical, Biotechnology, and Life 
Science sub-sector, we expect the rollout of new 
launches (we see the rollout of GSK’s vaccine for 
older adults against RSV with potential sales of 
USD1.9 billion by 2028, to be in focus) and core 
products (high demand for obesity treatment to 
continue being under the spotlight) to be the key 
growth drivers, providing some cushion to the 
lower Covid-19-related sales and the impact of 
lower early-stage funding in biotech. Margin-wise, 
we expect efficiency measures and better product 
mix to cushion price and cost pressure. In terms 
of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation, we view 
the financial impact from the first round of 
negotiations to be limited as the selected drugs no 
longer make up a large portion of the companies’ 
portfolio (those in the list include AstraZeneca’s 
Farxiga, Novartis’ Entresto, and Novo Nordisk’s 
Fiasp and Novorapid). Nevertheless, since the 
number of drugs selected for negotiation will 
increase each year, other blockbuster drugs could 
be added to the list in the future. Within our 
coverage, Novo Nordisk tops the sales and core 
EPS growth forecasts over 2023 and 2024 
supported by the strong demand for its GLP-1 
based diabetes and obesity treatments. At the opposite end, we see lower earnings for Bayer 
(weaker Crop Science division due to the 
softening glyphosate prices and continued 
pricing pressure in pharmaceutical division). 
For the Healthcare Equipment  Services sub-
sector, we see room for demand and margin 
recovery in 2023 and 2024 on the back of 
easing supply chain constraints and 
moderating energy prices (vs. 2022), though 
we are mindful of the wage inflation and 
pricing pressure from the implementation of 
the volume-based procurement program (VBP) 
in China. Within our coverage, Alcon (solid key 
products growth) and Philips (low comparison 
base after a very weak 2022) top the EPS 
growth forecast. That said, we are cautious on 
Philips due to the product recall related risk.

EQUITY Factsheet_ London Stock Exchange Group plc,"Highlights
uLondon Stock Exchange’s (LSE) H1 2023 
adjusted EBITDA was up 4% Y/Y to GBP1.87 bln 
and its revenue rose 12% Y/Y to GBP3.99 bln. 
The result was within expectation, with its 
adjusted EBITDA and revenue making up 50% 
and 49% of consensus full year 2023 estimates. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted to 46.9% 
(50.4%) due to non-cash FX-related balance 
sheet adjustment, impact of recent 
acquisitions, and product development costs. 
That said, LSE is still confident of hitting its full 
year EBITDA margin of ~48%.
uWe forecast high-single-digit CAGR in revenue 
for LSE over the next two years, driven by key 
long-term drivers such as growth of passive 
funds and the rising demand for data and 
digitalization. Near-term heightened market 
volatility will also benefit LSE’s trading-related 
revenues, in our view. We expect a mid-single-
digit rise in underlying operating expenses over 
the next two years, mainly driven by spending to 
improve operational resilience, expenditure on 
efficiency-related projects, and development of 
new products and services to drive future 
growth. 
uWe forecast EPS of GBP3.50 for 2023 and 
GBP3.90 for 2024. ","Investment Rationale/Risk
uOur call is 4-STARS (Buy). We believe LSE is 
strongly positioned to benefit from growing 
industry trends such as increasing use of data, 
the global nature of trading, and growth in 
passive investment strategies. The Refinitiv 
acquisition has improved LSE’s revenue profile, 
in our view, with LSE now relying less on uneven 
income from trading, diversifying into data 
distribution. We see momentum in LSE’s 
transformation as it upgraded 2025 run rate 
revenue synergy target to GBP350-400 mln vs. 
GBP225 mln and expects to deliver the 2025 
cost synergy target of GBP400 mln two years 
ahead of plan. We are positive about its 
partnership with Microsoft, which we think will 
allow LSE to capture market share, add further 
scalability and close down pricing gap with 
premium-priced competitors.
uKey downside risks  include a letdown in delivery 
targeted synergies, unsuccessful integration of  
acquired companies, and unfavorable regulatory 
changes.
uWe keep our 12-month target price for LSE at 
GBP95, reflecting 2023 P/E of 27x, largely in line 
with its 5-year average forward P/E of 28.2x. We 
think this fairly balances LSE’s changing 
business mix post-Refinitiv acquisition with 
current macro-economic headwinds.","Industry Outlook
We are neutral on EMEA financials. We think the 
sector in general will benefit from the higher 
interest rate environment in Europe. This is 
balanced by growing concerns about the economy, 
including slower growth and persistent inflation. 
The recent banking turmoil has also increased the 
scrutiny on the sector. 
For the bank sub-industry, we have a neutral view. 
We expect the European banks under our coverage 
will continue to benefit from the higher interest 
rate environment as inflation rate is still well above 
the European Central Bank’s target of 2%. As 
banks continue to pass more of the higher rate to 
their customers, we expect to see expanding net 
interest margin and net interest income. However, 
we expect loan loss provision to increase as 
consumers and businesses will start to feel the 
negative impact from the tough economic 
situation. Asset quality will also be tested and we 
will also start to see increases in non-performing 
loans. We think that the risk of a liquidity-related 
failure, such as the one that caused the collapse 
of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in the U.S., for 
European banks is well-contained, given the high 
liquidity coverage ratios (LCRs) of European banks 
as compared to their U.S. counterparts. Investors 
can take comfort in European banks’ capital levels 
that have greatly improved since the 2008 global 
financial crisis.
For the insurance sub-industry, we are neutral on 
its outlook. We see rising interest rate 
environment continues to benefit insurance 
companies, particularly life insurers, as it allows 
them to generate higher reinvestment yields and 
ease their obligation to meet government-
mandated returns on written policies. Also, the 
heightened market volatility is likely to support 
demand for pension risk transfer, in our view, as 
clients seek stability by de-risking their pension 
obligations. However, we are cautious about 
slowing growth in gross written premium and 
higher surrenders for life policies amid an 
anticipated subdued economic growth in Europe. 
For P&C insurers, the rise in claim cost inflation 
may normalize slightly in 2023 but remains challenging to navigate, in our opinion, as 
insurers’ attempt to eke out margin 
improvement by focusing on underwriting 
quality may come with the expense of weaker 
premium growth. Conversely, we believe the 
outlook for the reinsurers under our coverage 
is relatively more positive. 
We are also neutral on the asset management 
sub-industry, where we expect asset under 
management (AUM) growth to slow down amid 
macro uncertainties. Two of the main positive 
factors for AUM growth are new products and 
new geographic markets. Investments that 
have been made to target new sources of AUM 
in the retail space more efficiently and to 
attract new mandates (especially from 
institutional investors) by offering extended 
quantitative and big data solutions are also 
potential drivers for AUM growth, in our view. 
Despite relatively strong expectations for top-
line growth, fee income is expected to grow 
more slowly, which implies further falls in fee 
margin (as a percentage of AUM).
Year-to-date through July 20, 2023, the S&P 
Europe 350 Financials Index was up 8.8%, 
largely mirroring the performance of the 
broader market, represented by the S&P 
Europe 350 Index, which recorded a gain of 
8.9% during the same period.

EQUITY Factsheet_ Marks and Spencer Group plc,"Highlights
uMarks & Spencer (MKS) released a trading 
update covering the first 19 weeks of FY24 
(Mar.) up to August 12. MKS saw continued 
market share growth in both Clothing & Home 
and Food. Like-for-Like (LFL) sales growth 
came in as a positive to us, up 11% LFL and 6% 
LFL for Clothing & Home, and Food, respectively. 
Recall that in its FY23 results, MKS reported 
sales growth of 9.9%, driven by Clothing & 
Home (+11.5%), Food (+8.7%), and 
International (+12.6%). The sustained growth 
momentum reflects MKS’ attractive value 
proposition amid continued price investment, in 
our view. 
uAs part of its mid-term objectives, MKS targets 
adjusted operating martin (AOM) to c.4% and 
c.10% for Food, and Home & Clothing, 
respectively. Recall that FY23 AOM at 5.2% is 
behind FY22 at 6.5% as muted pricing activity 
was insufficient to offset sourcing and freight 
costs. In its trading update, MKS indicated 
“significant improvement against previous 
expectations (moderate revenue growth)”, 
which we attribute to the group’s positive 
progress towards its strategy, and relatively 
robust retail consumer spending. 
uWe raise our FY24 EPS to GBP0.20 (from 
GBP0.16) and FY25 to GBP0.23 (from GBP0.19).","Investment Rationale/Risk
uOur call is raised a notch to 4-STARS (Buy). MKS 
remains a quality retailer with strong heritage 
and brand value, in our view. We think its 
attractive portfolio of staples (Food) and 
discretionary (Clothing & Home) segments 
presents an opportunity for a stable and 
attractive return potential similar to a barbell 
position. Although Food may constitute a larger 
part of overall revenue (c.60%), fashion 
(Clothing & Home) remains to be the major key 
growth driver for MKS, in our opinion. While 
near-term profitability may be impeded by the 
need for further investment into its omni-
channel shopping experience, we still see robust 
wage growth and alleviating cost pressures to 
provide some headroom. We also expect to see 
further productivity benefits from its acquisition 
of Gist in 2022.
uMain downside risks to our recommendation 
and/or target price include failed or delayed 
store rotation program, drastic shift in stylistic 
preference away from MKS, and elevated price 
competition in food retail.
uOur 12-month target price for MKS at GBP2.50 
is based on FY24 P/E of 12.5x, which is a slight 
premium against its historical average of 11.0x, 
justified in our opinion by its improving outlook 
and strong turnaround.","Industry Outlook
We have a neutral 12-month fundamental outlook 
on EMEA Consumer Discretionary (Ex-Automobiles 
Components). Despite favorable trading results, in 
part due to the return of Chinese demand, and 
stronger economic data, we remain cautious over 
economic headwinds, including the high cost-of-
living situation and recessionary risks, and tough 
growth comparables. 
For the Apparel, Accessories, and Luxury Goods 
subsector, we have a neutral outlook. We believe 
topline performance peaked in 2022 and expect 
growth to moderate around the return of China 
demand, sustainability of pricing momentum, and 
U.S. local sales. High-end luxury companies with 
strong brand equity will take center stage this year 
due to the inelasticity of demand for their 
products and the growing composition of China 
sales in their regional portfolio (>30%), in our view. 
We expect to see operating margins returning to 
pre-pandemic levels from the supply chain 
recovery and further economies of scale. 
We have a neutral outlook on the Apparel Retail 
subsector. We expect a mixed performance 
between competitors due to a shift in consumer 
preference in 2023 towards “quality-and-price” 
rather than “value-based on-price”, in our view, as 
consumers begin to tighten their household 
budget. With expectations of stronger footfall, 
physical retail is expected to continue to make a 
return. We think margins will continue to recover 
as retailers are expected to see further cost 
savings trickling in from current programs and the 
absence of one-time costs for the winding up of 
Russian operations. 
We maintain our positive outlook on Casinos and 
Gaming. The subsector remains a long-term 
structural play with 2023 expected to be the year 
of positive EBITDA for U.S. sports betting and e-
gaming, particularly in H2. Other regions remain 
supportive of growth, and we look towards further 
updates on the progress of legislative agenda in 
grey markets, particularly Brazil. With the absence 
of major sporting tournaments this year, we 
expect to see margins continue to be pressured as 
marketing spend to support sales remains high. We are positive on Hotels, Resorts, and Cruise 
Lines over expectations of a strong operating 
environment with strong forward bookings and 
occupancy close to pre-pandemic levels. We 
expect the return of Chinese travellers, 
continued momentum in business travel 
demand, and supportive leisure travel demand 
to generate mid-to-high single-digit pricing. 
Though margins may continue to be impacted 
by the high cost of labor and energy costs, we 
believe this is contained by full-service hotels 
with significant exposure to the luxury market. 
YTD through September 29, 2023, the S&P 
Europe 350 Consumer Discretionary Index was 
up 8.5%, outperforming the broader S&P 
Europe 350 Index. The robust performance in 
discretionary and luxury spending such as 
perfumes and cosmetics has shown resilience 
even in the face of significant inflation and 
higher interest rates. Furthermore, we expect 
that luxury and other high-end goods will 
continue to shine, particularly among higher-
income consumers who maintain consistent 
spending habits regardless of economic 
conditions.
Sector valuation remains unattractive as it 
currently trades at 1-year forward P/E 
valuation of 11.7x vs. its 5-year average of 
10.5x. We find limited upside as we believe this 
has already priced in stronger investor 
sentiment for the consumer discretionary 
sector against a backdrop of recessionary risks 
and moderating growth from the Covid-19 
recovery.

EQUITY Factsheet_ Maxis Berhad,"Highlights
uThe recent service revenue recovery indicates 
some success for Maxis’ data and Home Fibre 
pivot. Its push for service convergence is 
positive, offsetting flattish Mobile service 
revenue. We also see some signs of a pickup in 
its Enterprise business. We project service 
revenue +3% in 2023 from higher Mobile service 
revenue (stable ARPU, subscriber gains for 
postpaid), Fibre, and Enterprise, and 
accelerating to +6% in 2024. In H1 2023, 
revenue +3%, on +3% service revenue growth 
(+5% consumer revenue on higher postpaid and 
fiber; Enterprise +5%). Consumer postpaid led 
revenue gains (+9% on higher subs offsetting 
weaker ARPU) on pre-to-post migration, while 
prepaid -2%. 
uWe see net margin to rise slightly in 2023, on 
Maxis’ focus on cost management and the lack 
of the Cukai Makmur impact in 2023. On the flip 
side, we see flat EBITDA margin as Maxis invests 
in emerging Enterprise services. We expect 
margin to see pressure in 2024 as Maxis plays a 
more direct role in the second 5G network 
rollout. In H1 2023, EBITDA +2%, with EBITDA 
service margin -0.4%pt on higher device costs 
and higher operation costs.
uWe forecast 2023-2024 EPS of MYR0.16 and 
MYR0.14. YTD 2023 DPS was MYR0.08, -20%.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uWe think revenue momentum from mobile 
services may stay tepid, but further 
deterioration is unlikely, while Maxis’postpaid 
strength, Home Fibre capabilities, and push for 
convergent services is positive. While the 
Celcom-Digi merger would not necessarily 
translate to lower prices (as this is value 
destructive for all), it does create a stronger 
competitor, weakening Maxis’market position, 
and reducing its network advantages. Further, 
we expect margin erosion as Maxis spends for 
the second 5G network rollout, particularly so if 
it aims to regain network advantage in the 5G 
race.
uKey upside risks to our recommendation and/or 
target price include: (i) higher margin from data 
expansion; (ii) significant customer and/or 
ARPU gains; (ii) lower-than-expected capex, 
spectrum, and content cost; and (iv) higher DPS 
payout.
uWe think current valuation is expensive given 
potential earnings deterioration, with Maxis at a 
slight premium vs. its 5-year average forward P/
E of 24x. A further cut to its dividends is not 
unlikely, given potential capex commitments 
and Maxis’ relatively more leveraged balance 
sheet. Our 12-month target price of MYR4.50 is 
at 28x our 2023 EPS estimate.","Industry Outlook
Our outlook for the APAC Wireless 
Telecommunications sub-industry is neutral.
The Asian wireless telecommunication market is in 
a state of transition. In markets that have 
launched 5G services, subscriber growth and 
revenue are picking up. However, in most markets 
without a 5G catalyst, the saturated space begets 
slower subscriber growth. Pricing power and data 
yields are falling as companies struggle to 
differentiate their offerings. Increased real-time 
connectivity and substitution into over-the-top 
(OTT) services raised the demand for data at lower 
yields, resulting in a lasting negative revenue 
impact. 
On the plus side, there is some evidence that the 
5G rollout in China, Japan, South Korea, and 
Taiwan had some positive impact on ARPU and 
subscriber growth, which may help stabilize 
revenue momentum for players in these markets 
heading into 2023. Further, digitalization of the 
consumer experience and enterprise services are 
also positive revenue drivers in developed markets, 
with operators leveraging on the always-on multi-
device connectivity, low latency, and high data 
speeds offered by their 5G and fiber networks. 
Most telcos in the region are looking to transition 
away from being solely a data pipe provider 
towards extracting more value by moving into 
adjacent, value-added digital services such as 
media  content, financial technology, and 
cybersecurity. 
The advent of 5G technology, with its ultra-low 
latency and simultaneous connectivity features, is 
a greater disruptive step change from simply 
providing faster speeds. In the long run, 5G will 
enable different revenue opportunities, including 
machine-to-machine communications (i.e., the 
Internet of Things), self-driving cars, and business 
virtual/augmented reality applications. However, in 
the short to medium term, we forecast 
monetization will be more limited to consumer use 
cases, particularly as 5G subscriber share 
increases in developed markets. 
We expect capital expenditures (capex) to rise 
year-over-year in 2023, as the industry compensates for delayed 5G rollout due to 
Covid-19. We believe this will pressure industry 
cash flows but will be offset by evidence of 
some revenue growth from 5G adoption. 
Nonetheless, we expect 5G capex in Asia to 
have peaked in 2022, with further growth to 
see measured rollout in tandem with growing 
consumer and enterprise use cases, and as 
companies take a shared approach to network 
expansion for 5G.
Regulatory action in recent years, whether on 
tariffs (e.g., Malaysia on fixed broadband; 
China, Japan, and South Korea on mobile data) 
or on competition (e.g., Australia’s initial 
opposition to the TPG Telecom and Vodafone 
Hutchison merger), indicates elevated risk. 
Competitive risks are also high with new 
entrants in Singapore, Australia, and the 
Philippines. However, these risks have receded 
in the last 12 months as the issues raised by 
the regulators were addressed and as new 
competition is digested.
In a low-growth environment, we expect 
companies to look for opportunities for synergy 
and scale via M&A. However, regional 
complications represent significant barriers to 
cross-border M&A, in CFRA’s view. This is 
exemplified by Axiata and Telenor’s initial 
failure in 2020 to merge their telecom assets 
in Asia (although this was completed in 2022 
at the second attempt).

EQUITY Factsheet_ Merck & Co. Inc.,"Highlights
uQ2 revenues of $15B, up 3% Y/Y, were higher 
than estimates due to higher-than-anticipated 
sales from the key oncology drug Keytruda 
(42% of total, +19% Y/Y) across all indications 
and the HPV vaccine Gardasil (16% of total, 
+47% Y/Y). In line with expectations, Lagevrio  
(antiviral to treat Covid-19) sales continued 
their sharp Y/Y decline (-82% Y/Y) due to lower 
demand. The 1% Y/Y revenue decline in Animal 
Health (10% of total sales) was slightly above 
our expectations as livestock underperformed 
this quarter (-2% Y/Y).
uIn June 2023, MRK completed the acquisition of 
the  smaller rival Prometheus Biosciences  in an 
all-cash deal valued at $10.8B. The deal boosts 
MRK’s immunology portfolio and increases its 
research capabilities. We also see strength in 
MRK’s cardiology and oncology portfolios, and 
the possibility of extending the use of Keytruda 
and Lynparza for a wider set of indications in 
oncology is a plus. Also, MRK’s joint venture with 
Moderna offers longer-term potential for 
individualized cancer treatment.  
uIn July, Merck upgraded its 2023 revenue 
guidance, which now stands in the range of 
$58.6B-$58.9B. We now expect MRK sales to be 
roughly flat Y/Y (+0.1%) vs. a 0.4% decline 
earlier.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uOur opinion is Buy, following Q2 earnings. While 
we anticipate a more challenging second half of 
the year and revised our estimates accordingly, 
starting in 2024 we think Merck will be well 
positioned again for healthier growth. We also 
expect to see more visible contributions in 2024 
from the recent acquisition of Prometheus 
Bioscience, which closed in June. We see the 
recent pullback seen since the end of June as a 
buying opportunity. Near term, we think MRK will 
also continue to benefit from the November 
2021 acquisition of Acceleron Pharma (AXLN). 
Adding AXLN boosted MRK’s presence in the 
expanding cardiovascular disease treatment 
market, in our view. 
uRisks to our view and target include R&D 
pipeline failures, lower-than-expected market 
share for Keytruda and vaccines, and the 
potential for unfavorable U.S. regulations on 
drug prices. 
uOur 12-month target of $124, 14.8x our 2024 
EPS view, is a discount to MRK’s 10-year 
historical forward P/E average. We continue to 
find MRK is attractive at current valuations and 
think the recently announced Prometheus 
acquisition will likely accelerate the firm’s 
immunology pipeline. ","Industry Outlook
Our outlook for the pharmaceutical sub-industry is 
neutral. We expect an improved outlook for the 
rest of 2023, partly predicated on a return to 
normalcy, with improved utilization and electives 
demand. Contributions from new launches with a 
focus on Alzheimer’s disease, obesity, and 
oncology will remain key growth drivers as a 
number of pharmaceutical firms see loss of 
exclusivities and face increasing competition. We 
also expect tough comparisons Y/Y due to lower 
demand for Covid-19 vaccines and treatments. 
Going forward, we expect Covid-related activity to 
shift to a seasonal phenomenon, like the flu. While 
there may be further surges in Covid-related sales, 
we expect a more annuity-like pattern to such 
sales.
One concern is the possibility of a recession, which 
could weigh on electives demand. Yet, key 
therapeutic areas seen as essential, such as 
oncology and immunology, are likely to see 
ongoing demand, in our view, and could be 
relatively less susceptible to slowdowns.
CFRA thinks health care policy risks are on the 
rise. Reducing drug prices continues to be a 
bipartisan issue as both parties aim for more 
affordable drug prices for Americans. The Inflation 
Reduction Act (IRA) allows Medicare to directly 
negotiate prices on the top 10 branded drugs for 
Medicare Part D coverage, with revised pricing 
taking effect in January 2026, and later expanding 
to 20 branded drugs in 2028. The Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services published the list of 
the first 10 top-selling prescription drugs selected 
for negotiations on August 29, 2023, which 
includes drugs from large U.S. Pharmaceutical 
companies (BMY, PFE, LLY, MRK, JNJ). The 
negotiated maximum fair prices for these drugs 
will be published by September 1, 2024. We think 
the IRA may also have implications for companies. 
For example, if pharmaceutical firms know that 
new blockbusters may get negotiated down, they 
may price them higher at launch. The act may also 
have implications as to where firms decide to 
invest.
We also note that the FTC appears to be taking a more active stance on antitrust review, but has 
not moved so far to block them. We think there 
may be increased scrutiny for potential 
pharmaceutical M&A, especially following the 
FTC’s lawsuit against Amgen’s acquisition of 
Horizon, which was later settled, and 
successfully closed.
Global minimum taxation of at least 15% on 
multinationals with more than $890 million in 
annual revenue proposed by the U.S. and 
backed by 137 countries is scheduled to take 
effect at the beginning of 2024. We foresee 
that this would potentially hurt the bottom-line 
profitability of large multinational 
pharmaceuticals.
We expect major generic makers to continue to 
struggle due to lower-cost emerging market 
competition. We think India-based generic 
makers will continue to take market share from 
developed nation firms due to lower production 
costs. We also expect Chinese pharmaceuticals 
to shift some of their resources away from 
generics and focus on more lucrative 
innovative drugs, which could increase 
competitive pressures. We also see a rise in 
biosimilars, which, while more expensive to 
produce than generics, will likely get a longer 
period of time before the field gets crowded 
with other biosimilars in the same category.

EQUITY Factsheet_ OMV Aktiengesellschaft,"Highlights
uOMV’s Q2 2023 adjusted income of EUR472 (-
67% Y/Y; -54% Q/Q) missed the consensus 
estimate by 14%. All three core segments 
deteriorated, primarily on lower olefin and 
polyolefin margins, a significant reduction in 
refining margins, and lower energy prices. Also, 
OMV’s Q2 2023 operational performance was 
uninspiring, in our view, as the utilization rates 
of refineries and steam crackers were merely 
73% and 83%, respectively (lower than initial 
2023 guidance of 95% and 90%, respectively), 
whereas hydrocarbon production was down 7% 
Y/Y to 353 kboe/d. Operating cash flow pre-
working capital turned negative in Q2 2023, 
lifting leverage to 11% versus 2% in Q1 2023. 
uOMV lowered its 2023 guidance by slashing 
estimated oil & gas price realization, polyolefin 
margin, and refining margin alongside reducing 
the estimated utilization rate of crackers and 
refinery.  We expect earnings downside linked to 
downstream and EU gas exposures. Also, 
hydrocarbon production is set to decrease due 
to the depletion of old assets, and the exclusion 
of Russian volume, which faces increased risks 
due to sanctions against Russia.
uWe forecast EPS of EUR9.00 for 2023 and 
EUR8.00 for 2024.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uOur call is 2-STARS (Sell). The company has 
relatively huge exposure in downstream, i.e. 
chemicals and refining, which we think will be 
vulnerable to our anticipated weakening of the 
refining environment in the remainder of 2023 
given the continued flow of Russian refined 
petroleum products to non-sanctioning 
countries and the oil production cut by OPEC+. 
In addition, uncertainty on Russian gas supplies 
and our anticipated lower energy prices in 2023 
do not bode well for OMV. The deterioration of 
operating cash flow pre-working capital was 
sharper compared to peers, which we think will 
lift OMV’s leverage (11% in Q2 2023) and limit 
OMV’s ability to provide attractive cash yield to 
shareholders. Meanwhile, the planned ADNOC/
Chems combination (combining Borealis and 
Borouge businesses to create a new global 
polyolefin powerhouse) may take time to come 
to fruition, in our view.
uUpside risks to our target price and/or 
recommendation include higher oil prices and 
better downstream margins.  
uOur 12-month target price for OMV of EUR35, 
reflecting a P/NAV of 0.6x, a discount to peer P/
NAV average of 1.2x, is justified in our view by 
OMV’s riskier geopolitical exposure and 
downstream bias.","Industry Outlook
Following the outperformance of European Energy 
sector in 2022 (EMEA Energy up 32% versus S&P 
350 down 12%), the sector was largely flat in 2023 
(YTD August), underperforming S&P 350, which 
was up 10%. Consequently, the Energy sector PE 
multiple versus S&P 350 has widened and is now 
at close to a 50% discount, approaching the lower 
end of its historical discount against S&P350 of 
50-60%. We think the current discount is 
becoming more reasonable, but weak global 
economic activities deter us from turning fully 
positive on the EMEA Energy sector, therefore 
maintaining our opinion of Market Weight for 
European Energy.
World oil supply growth is expected to slow to 1.4 
million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2023 versus 4.7 
mb/d growth in 2022, according to International 
Energy Agency (IEA), as production expansion 
from Non-Opec+ (i.e., U.S. and Brazil) will be 
partially offset by a production cut by OPEC+. 
OPEC+ cut its crude oil production to a near two-
year low in July 2023 as a major voluntary cut by 
Saudi Arabia took effect. The voluntary cut is 
expected to continue till September 2023 and to 
be extended if necessary. 
According to IEA, oil demand in 2023 is set to rise 
by 2.2 mb/d to a record high of 102.1 mb/d, 
surpassing the pre-pandemic level. The rise in 
demand is expected to be led by the gain from 
non-OECD countries, specifically China, rather 
than OECD countries. Therefore, we think there 
may be a risk for the strong demand forecast to 
fall through, given that China’s recovery appears to 
be lackluster with multiple GDP forecast 
downgrades following its release of Q2 2023 
economic data. Meanwhile, the global oil 
inventories have grown steadily in H1 2023, easing 
the tremendous tightness felt by the industry 
previously. 
As we access the supply and demand holistically, 
we think the additional OPEC+ cut in H2 2023 may 
result in increasing draws in inventories and oil on 
water, thus limiting further build-up whilst 
introducing renewed volatility to the market. As of 
August 2023, EIA forecasts Brent crude oil prices averaging USD82/barrel in 2023 and USD86/
barrel in 2024. Although the forecasts may not 
be as robust as 2022’s USD101/barrel, the 
gradual improvement versus its previous May 
2023 forecast of USD79/barrel in 2023 and 
USD74/barrel in 2024 certainly signals rowing 
optimism in oil prices, in our view.
Overall, we expect that integrated oil players, 
particularly those that have a dominant 
contribution from exploration and production 
will generate lower earnings in 2023 because 
the negative pricing effect will likely offset any 
small increase in volumes. Also, significantly 
lower refining margins will drag the earnings of 
integrated oil players. Cash yield to 
shareholders is expected to be substantial in 
2023, but we think it may experience a steep 
step-down in 2024 as free cash flow drops and 
companies become more leveraged.
Meanwhile, we remain more positive on the 
energy equipment and service providers after a 
transition year in 2022, where they executed 
contracts won during the prior trough period, 
which in our view, generated lower margins. We 
believe their improving order books with 
favorable pricing and payment terms alongside 
stronger tender pipelines are likely to boost 
2023 earnings. Furthermore, we believe they 
will be catalyzed by the reduced availability of 
energy and service providers alongside growth 
in the offshore renewable space.

EQUITY Factsheet_ Partners Group Holding AG (2),"Highlights
uPartners Group (PGHN) reported 9% Y/Y growth 
in assets under management (AUM) to 
USD141.7 bln as of H1 2023, driven by new 
commitments of USD8.0 bln (H1 2022: USD13.1 
bln). The company invested USD5.0 bln (H1 
2022: USD13.4 bln) as it continues to grow its 
thematic investment pipeline. Portfolio 
realization was USD5.4 bln, down from USD6.4 
bln a year ago, but we think this was 
commendable given the challenging market 
environment. We expect fundraising to improve 
in H2 2023, supported by continuing 
normalization in the pace of client conversions 
as well as new strategies coming to market.
uPGHN guides for expected gross client demand 
of USD17-22 bln in 2023, down from USD22-26 
bln it guided previously for 2022. We believe this 
reflects the lower risk appetite among its clients 
amid increasing macro uncertainties, which 
may lead to slower AUM growth. That said, we 
see improved performance fees for PGHN in 
2023 as we expect realizations to recover from 
the low level experienced in 2022. However, this 
is subject to market conditions and we may 
need to wait until the second half of 2023 to 
see realizations start to materialize.
uWe forecast EPS of CHF42 for 2023 and CHF52 
for 2024.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uWe see increasing demand for investments in 
the private markets amid an increasingly volatile 
public market. Despite a challenging market 
environment, PGHN still managed to grow its 
AUM. While rising interest rates could potentially 
lower returns in the investment portfolio, we 
note that on an absolute basis rates are not 
different than before the pandemic, and PGHN 
may have staggered debt schedules, which 
decrease margin pressure. Increased focus on 
opportunities related to ESG and sectors 
underrepresented in public markets (such as 
industrial digitization) should provide a healthy 
tailwind to AUM growth, in our view. Valuation is 
attractive, trading at 2024 P/E of 18.0x vs. its 5-
year average forward P/E of 26.6x. Improvement 
in fund flows is a key catalyst for the re-rating 
of its shares, in our view.
uKey risks to our thesis include macroeconomic 
shocks, fee pressure, and negative regulatory 
changes.
uWe raise our 12-month target price to 
CHF1,100 (from CHF900), reflecting 2024 P/E 
of 21.2x, above peer average forward P/E of 
10.0x, justified in our view by PGHN’s superior 
ROE profile (forward ROE of more than 30% vs. 
peers’ ~10%).","Industry Outlook
We are neutral on EMEA financials. We think the 
sector in general will benefit from the higher 
interest rate environment in Europe. This is 
balanced by growing concerns about the economy, 
including slower growth and persistent inflation. 
The recent banking turmoil has also increased the 
scrutiny on the sector. 
For the bank sub-industry, we have a neutral view. 
We expect the European banks under our coverage 
will continue to benefit from the higher interest 
rate environment as inflation rate is still well above 
the European Central Bank’s target of 2%. As 
banks continue to pass more of the higher rate to 
their customers, we expect to see expanding net 
interest margin and net interest income. However, 
we expect loan loss provision to increase as 
consumers and businesses will start to feel the 
negative impact from the tough economic 
situation. Asset quality will also be tested and we 
will also start to see increases in non-performing 
loans. We think that the risk of a liquidity-related 
failure, such as the one that caused the collapse 
of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in the U.S., for 
European banks is well-contained, given the high 
liquidity coverage ratios (LCRs) of European banks 
as compared to their U.S. counterparts. Investors 
can take comfort in European banks’ capital levels 
that have greatly improved since the 2008 global 
financial crisis.
For the insurance sub-industry, we are neutral on 
its outlook. We see rising interest rate 
environment continues to benefit insurance 
companies, particularly life insurers, as it allows 
them to generate higher reinvestment yields and 
ease their obligation to meet government-
mandated returns on written policies. Also, the 
heightened market volatility is likely to support 
demand for pension risk transfer, in our view, as 
clients seek stability by de-risking their pension 
obligations. However, we are cautious about 
slowing growth in gross written premium and 
higher surrenders for life policies amid an 
anticipated subdued economic growth in Europe. 
For P&C insurers, the rise in claim cost inflation 
may normalize slightly in 2023 but remains challenging to navigate, in our opinion, as 
insurers’ attempt to eke out margin 
improvement by focusing on underwriting 
quality may come with the expense of weaker 
premium growth. Conversely, we believe the 
outlook for the reinsurers under our coverage 
is relatively more positive. 
We are also neutral on the asset management 
sub-industry, where we expect asset under 
management (AUM) growth to slow down amid 
macro uncertainties. Two of the main positive 
factors for AUM growth are new products and 
new geographic markets. Investments that 
have been made to target new sources of AUM 
in the retail space more efficiently and to 
attract new mandates (especially from 
institutional investors) by offering extended 
quantitative and big data solutions are also 
potential drivers for AUM growth, in our view. 
Despite relatively strong expectations for top-
line growth, fee income is expected to grow 
more slowly, which implies further falls in fee 
margin (as a percentage of AUM).
Year-to-date through July 20, 2023, the S&P 
Europe 350 Financials Index was up 8.8%, 
largely mirroring the performance of the

uWe estimate 2023 revenue growth of 10% as we 
see core price remaining elevated and, coupled 
with acquisitions, contributing to additional 
expansion in sales. RSG’s customer retention 
rate has remained solid at 94%+, despite 
pricing actions taken in recent quarters. We 
anticipate organic volumes being flat to slightly 
positive in 2023, with pricing and acquisitions 
driving top-line growth. Recycled commodity 
prices meaningfully contracted in 2022 on 
unfavorable supply-demand, though prices are 
expected to recover in 2023 with RSG 
estimating an average recycled commodity 
price of $110-115 per ton.
uWe expect the EBITDA margin to expand 30 bps 
in 2023 to 29.4%. Improved route metrics 
support margins through increased productivity. 
RSG is managing costs by replacing older 
trucks, reducing emissions, improving driver 
productivity, and increasing conversions to 
natural gas vehicles to reduce fuel costs. Pricing 
remains robust, with a positive price/cost 
expected to support margin expansion in the 
coming quarters.
uRSG believes that quality acquisitions result in 
the most long-term shareholder value creation, 
with CFRA expecting over $600M of deals being 
completed by year-end 2023.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uWe view RSG as well positioned to benefit from 
stable volumes and favorable pricing trends as 
its markets expand. We maintain a positive view 
of the increased focus on renewable natural gas 
projects but are more mixed on RSG’s expansion 
into hazardous waste. In the near term, RSG will 
likely focus on tuck-in acquisitions within its 
core business (solid waste and recycling) 
following the acquisition of U.S. Ecology. RSG 
continues to lower its recycling earnings 
sensitivity to be less responsive to commodity 
price volatility, which fell to an average price of 
$170 per ton in 2022 (down 9% from 2021). We 
see RSG integrating electric vehicles into its 
fleet ahead of peers, although wide-scale 
adoption is still several years off.
uRisks to our rating and target include worse-
than-expected activity in the housing market 
and economy, a decline in customer retention 
rates due to competitive pricing, a rapid decline 
in commodity recycling prices, and sharply 
higher fuel/commodity costs.
uOur 12-month target  of $162 values shares at 
27.6x our 2024 EPS estimate, in line with RSG’s 
three-year historical average given our outlook 
for pricing momentum, balanced by execution 
risk surrounding U.S. Ecology.","Industry Outlook
Our positive 12-month fundamental outlook for 
the Environmental & Facilities Services sub-
industry is based on our view that the companies 
in the sub-industry are defensive compared to the 
broader market, which we view favorably amid 
ongoing macro uncertainty across global markets. 
We anticipate organic growth to be driven by core 
pricing that remains above historical levels despite 
a still competitive environment. Pricing has 
become a focal point as companies work to offset 
lingering impacts from cost inflation. We forecast 
core price at roughly 6% as firms continue to 
leverage the inflationary environment, though we 
see pricing contributions cooling in 2024. We 
expect recycling commodity prices to recover in 
2023-2024, following the slump in pricing for old 
corrugated containers during the second half of 
2022. We view impacts from volatility in the 
recycling line of business as manageable as 
recycling operations are, on average, only about 
5% of a waste company’s revenue. Although 
landfill capacity averages more than 20 years, 
landfill prices (landfills tend to generate higher 
margins) should rise over the next few years as 
more third-party waste is disposed of in the 
largest haulers’ landfills. 
We expect full-year construction and demolition 
(C&D) volumes to be positive in 2023-2024 
despite the interest rate driven slowdown in 
housing, with activity from the $1.2 trillion federal 
infrastructure bill, Inflation Reduction Act, and 
CHIPS Act being tailwinds. Commercial waste 
collection volumes have begun to flatten following 
a strong post-pandemic recovery. In early 2020, 
residential volumes were well above average at the 
start of the pandemic, causing increased 
processing costs on the collectors, but volume 
normalized through the second half of the year. 
Overall, contract structure and payment are based 
on collection frequency, not volume, so the 
normalization of residential volumes (down from 
elevated levels in 2020) has aided operator 
profitability. We see residential volumes being flat 
to slightly negative in 2023 and stable in 2024. 
In our view, the largest North American haulers will continue to divest underperforming assets and 
make selective, accretive acquisitions while 
seeking to enhance customer service as an 
incentive to maintain a high retention rate. We 
expect acquisitions to remain a key lever for 
top-line growth and market share expansion as 
smaller haulers experience operating 
difficulties in this highly regulated and capital-
intensive industry. Negative impacts from the 
inflationary environment could potentially lead 
to more attractive opportunities for 
acquisitions during 2023, in our view. We see a 
growing environmental trend from the 
conversion of methane gas at landfills into 
energy and expect industry incumbents to 
ramp up investment in gas-to-energy 
infrastructure and operations as firms 
capitalize on tax credits introduced by the 
Inflation Reduction Act. We look for solid free 
cash flow generation to be targeted for debt 
reduction, strategic “tuck-in” acquisitions, 
growth capital expenditures, dividend 
payments, and share repurchases, in addition 
to automation investments toward recycling.

CFRA has a positive fundamental outlook for the 
S&P 500 systems software sub-industry in the 
next 12 months, as we expect incremental 
improvement in the economic landscape, pent-up 
demand from postponed digital transformation 
projects, and growing interest in generative AI 
tools. Slower spending is still expected in the short 
term, as stubborn inflation (aggravated by recent 
spikes in energy prices) is giving the Fed some 
hesitation to loosen its hawkish monetary policy 
stance. Yet, we believe it is likely that we will still 
start to see rate cuts in 2024, giving businesses 
some relief from the pressures experienced over 
the last year.
Enterprise software spending remained 
constrained in Q2 as customers refrained from 
spending in less critical areas of the business, 
while continuing to whittle down redundancies. 
Consequently, cloud optimization behavior 
remained a headwind to growth, and cloud 
providers expect their customers to continue this 
process of optimizing their existing workloads and 
infrastructure use in Q3. However, we are 
encouraged that more companies have observed 
higher levels of stabilization to demand, and the 
likelihood that growth compression has 
“bottomed” is increasing.
Cybersecurity firms in the Systems Software sub-
industry remained conservative with their outlook 
for the year, but highlighted improvements in the 
demand environment. We note pockets of 
outperformance during the quarter from strong 
execution, and a higher velocity of large deals and 
significant commitments from new customers, 
reflecting better-than-expected enterprise 
appetite for cybersecurity solutions. We think this 
is a positive set up for 2024 as budget challenges 
ease. As with the major cloud providers, we are 
cautiously optimistic that cybersecurity firms will 
start to see a headwinds-to-tailwinds shift when 
companies become more confident about ramping 
their security investments again.
The pace of generative AI developments across 
the technology ecosystem also supports our 
positive view of the sub-industry. Cloud providers are increasing investments to build the 
necessary infrastructure for generative AI 
workloads, while launching a slew of 
applications and services. For example, 
Microsoft released Azure AI to allow developers 
to build and deploy their proprietary AI 
solutions, and announced Microsoft 365 
Copilot to enhance productivity for its millions 
of users. Smaller software vendors have also 
started to launch generative-AI features. 
DevOps software provider Gitlab has made 
Code Suggestions available in beta to help 
developers shorten production time. These 
innovations underscore the growing 
importance and value offered by generative AI. 
While we are still in the early stages of 
adoption, we believe that market interest in 
generative AI will be sustained, driving new 
sources of revenue for the software industry.
Consensus projections for the software 
industry align with what we believe are the 
drivers for growth in the near term. Software 
companies in the S&P 500 are expected to 
grow revenue at 9.8% in 2023, down from 
12.7% in 2022. However, growth is forecasted 
to accelerate 11.8% in 2024 as organizations 
return to IT modernization projects and look to 
ways to invest in generative AI. Spending on 
generative AI can be costly, especially for cloud 
providers, and we expect some impact to 
earnings, offset by cost savings and efficiency 
gains in 2023.

uSociete Generale’s (GLE) Q2 2023 underlying net 
income fell 22% Y/Y to EUR1.16 bln but was 
ahead of S&P Capital IQ consensus estimate of 
EUR744 mln. The result was dragged by lower 
revenues in French retail banking (-14%), 
reflecting contraction in net interest margin due 
to local consumer protection rule that caps the 
pace at which banks can pass on interest rate 
rises to households. Investment banking 
revenues were down 7% on the back of less 
favorable market environment. While underlying 
operating expenses were stable, it was also a 
reflection of weaker revenues.
uWe expect the net interest margin pressure in 
France to continue until 2024, resulting in GLE’s 
continued underperformance against peers in 
posting higher retail bank revenues. We think 
GLE’s exposure to international markets should 
be able to support a softer performance in 
France. Past cost actions and ongoing

uOur call is 2-STARS (Sell). We expect the

unexciting outlook for GLE in 2023, as it 
continues to focus on the merger of its French 
retail networks. While GLE’s asset quality has 
not shown any sign of stress so far, its low non-
performing loans (NPL) coverage ratio of ~50% 
is a concern amid a challenging economic 
outlook, as it could result in a higher increase in 
its cost of risk moving forward should the

the next 12 months is neutral. We believe the 
industry in general will benefit from the higher 
interest rate environment. This is balanced by 
growing concerns about the economy, including 
slower growth and persistent inflation.
Year-to-date through 30 September 2023, the 
S&P Europe 350 Financials Index was up 9.2%, 
outperforming the broader market, represented by 
the S&P Europe 350 Index, which recorded a gain 
of 6.5% during the same period.
For the bank sub-industry, we have a neutral view. 
Signs of easing interest rate tailwind have 
gathered momentum even as the European 
Central Bank (ECB) raised its interest rate for the 
10th consecutive time in September 2023 by 
another 0.25%-pts to an all-time high of 4.0%. 
The ECB has signaled its intention to keep rates on 
hold in the future. That said, we still expect banks 
to see expanding net interest income and net 
interest margins in H2 2023. We expect this to 
normalize in 2024 due to rising pass-through 
rates, a gradual decline in sector-wide customer 
deposits, peaking policy rates, slower loans 
growth, and weaker macroeconomic prospects. 
We see higher operating expenses driven by wages 
and general inflation, IT, and compliance. We 
expect rising loan loss provisions in the coming 
months as consumers and businesses will start to 
feel the negative impact from higher interest rates 
and inflation.
Our fundamental outlook for the insurance sub-
industry is neutral. The challenge for life insurers 
in managing asset-liability and duration (given the 
long-term nature of policyholder obligations) 
caused by the rapid interest rate hikes should 
ease, in our view, as the uptrend in interest rates is 
likely to end in the near term. We expect improving 
investment yields to support the earnings of life 
insurers but are wary of slowing growth in gross 
written premiums amid our anticipated lackluster 
economic activities in Europe. For P&C insurers, 
we think profitability is set to improve amid our 
anticipation of easing heavy natural catastrophe 
claims that plagued most P&C insurers in recent years, moderated claim cost inflation, and firm 
pricing of new coverages. As for the reinsurers, 
consensus earnings expectations are 
becoming lofty, in our opinion, fully accounting 
for the benefit of the hardening market in the 
reinsurance segment. We note that the 
average projected shareholder cash yield of 
reinsurers is merely 5%, nearly half of the 
projected cash yield of the insurance sub-
industry.
We are also neutral on the asset management 
sub-industry, where we expect asset under 
management (AUM) growth to slow down amid 
macro uncertainties. Two of the main positive 
factors for AUM growth are new products and 
new geographic markets. Investments that 
have been made to target new sources of AUM 
in the retail space more efficiently and to 
attract new mandates (especially from 
institutional investors) by offering extended 
quantitative and big data solutions are also 
potential drivers for AUM growth, in our view. 
Despite relatively strong expectations for top-
line growth, fee income is expected to grow 
more slowly, which implies further falls in fee 
margin (as a percentage of AUM).

uQ2 sales fell 14% Y/Y on volume declines in 
Titanium Technologies and the Advanced 
Performance Materials portfolio, partially offset 
by pricing gains. Volume declines were 27% in 
TT, 1% in Thermal & Specialized Solutions, and 
9% in APM. We believe CC will see sales declines 
of 6% in 2023 and 3% in 2024 given its large 
presence in the manufacturing of harmful 
chemicals in most of its segments. 
uIts TSS segment has a leading position in the 
fluorochemicals market and its APM segment 
produces products containing PFAS and Gen-X 
(previously known as C8), all of which are highly 
toxic and have been linked to certain cancers. 
We believe possible regulatory pressure may 
eliminate or restrict CC’s ability to produce 
products containing these chemicals.
u Q2 EBIT margin declined Y/Y on lower volumes 
and higher input/raw material costs, partially 
offset by strong pricing. We think EBIT margin 
will contract in 2023 with high raw material 
prices, such as chlorine. Also, with  lower 
forecasted volumes and days sales inventory 
(DSI) rising to 107 days in Q2 2023 from 78 
days in Q2 2022, we believe margins will be 
under significant pressure. We estimate 2023 
and 2024 EBIT margin to contract 225 bps and  
100 bps.","Investment Rationale/Risk
u Our Strong Sell rating is driven by our view that 
CC will face significant legal issues given its 
involvement in many lawsuits. In one of CC’s 
most recent settlements in Stuart, FL, the 
company paid out $592M to resolve complaints 
of CC polluting many U.S. drinking water 
systems with harmful chemicals (PFAS). This is 
just one of many cases, with plaintiffs including 
water providers, airports, a number of states, 
and private well owners, with possible personal 
injury claims from individuals. PA became the 
latest state to sue, accusing CC and DD of 
marketing these chemicals to firefighting foam 
manufacturers in the state, despite knowing 
they posed health dangers. We think CC is a big 
liability, and believe some form of regulation will 
be put into place, ultimately eliminating/
restricting CC’s ability to produce/sell its 
products.
u Risks to our Strong Sell rating include no 
further lawsuits against CC (unlikely) and no 
regulation of these chemicals ever being put 
into place.
u Our 12-month price target is $21 using a 
forward P/E of 6.5x our 2024 EPS estimate, 
below the five-year average of 7.6x, on lower 
expected demand for CC’s products, margin 
issues with DSI moving up, and the many 
lawsuits.","Industry Outlook
Our fundamental outlook for the diversified 
chemicals sub-industry for the next 12 months is 
neutral. We think sub-industry participants are 
positioned to benefit in a normalized environment 
(post-supply chain challenges) as well as from 
federal infrastructure spending, a steady growth 
trend in auto production, and positive trends in 
nonresidential construction (NRC). However, we 
note that high interest and mortgage rates could 
have adverse impacts on customer demand in 
home buying and believe the sub-industry will see 
a slow do-it-yourself (DIY) and repair & 
remodeling (R&R) markets.
R&R activity has been on the decline since Q3 
2022 and the Leading Indicator of Remodeling 
Activity (LIRA), which measures the change in 
homeowner R&R spending on a four-quarter 
moving average, projects R&R spending to 
decrease from a reported 9.5% in Q2 to an 
estimated -5.9% by Q2 2024 (as of July 2023). 
Additionally, existing home sales are on the 
decline, decreasing 15% from August 2022 to 
August 2023. We expect this decrease in existing 
home sales and R&R to continue throughout the 
year and think companies that produce chemicals 
used in products for DIY and R&R markets, such 
as paints, coatings, sealants, and adhesives, will 
see a decline in demand and decreased revenue/
earnings in 2023 and into 2024. That said, we have 
a positive long-term view on this market given the 
age of U.S. homes and given the supply of new 
homes remains historically low relative to demand 
levels.
We believe nonresidential construction is a 
positive given the recent rise in NRC spending and 
positive projected growth in 2023 and into 2024. 
NRC spending has increased 27% from July 2022 
to July 2023, with manufacturing, health care, and 
education construction spending on the rise as 
businesses reshore operations back to the U.S. 
and hospitals and schools/universities make 
upgrades and expansions that were not in budget 
during the Covid-19 pandemic. As of July 2023, 
construction spending for education is up 13%, 
healthcare +20%, and manufacturing +71% since one year ago. We also believe diversified 
chemicals will benefit from federal 
infrastructure spending due to the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Framework that was signed into 
law in November 2021. Roads and bridges have 
the highest budget allocation at 57%. We 
believe the increase in spending will bode well 
for revenue and earnings in companies that 
manufacture and sell products with industrial 
and institutional construction exposure, such 
as industrial coatings, concretes, polymers, 
and other applications.
Diversified chemicals also have meaningful 
exposure to vehicle production, which we see 
as a positive in 2023 and into 2024. From July 
2022 to July 2023, domestic auto production 
rose 6%, according to S&P Global Mobility, and 
global light vehicle production is expected to 
rise 5% in 2023 and 1.4% in 2024, with North 
American production forecasted to rise 8% in 
2023 and 2% in 2024 (as of July 2023). We 
believe favorable auto production trends will 
bode well for diversified chemicals that support 
the auto industry including refrigerants, tire 
additives, polymers, and coatings.
YTD through September 28, 2023, the S&P 
1500 Diversified Chemicals Index has 
decreased 7%, underperforming both the S&P 
1500 Index (+11%) and the S&P 1500 
Materials Sector Index (+1%).

uWe forecast operating revenue growth of 8%-
12% in 2023, amid our view that net earned 
premiums (which account for about 90% of 
revenues) will rise by 9%-12%, net investment 
income (8%) will be flat to up 5%, and fee and 
other revenues (2%) will rise by 5%-8%. Our 
forecasted rate of revenue growth reflects what 
we expect will be a strong pricing environment 
and stable demand for coverage in 2023.
uOur operating profit forecast assumes that 
underwriting results remain profitable and that 
TRV’s prior-year loss development trends 
remain positive. Results in 2022 reflected a 2% 
rise in an already elevated level of after-tax 
catastrophe losses, offset by a significant 
improvement in prior-year loss development 
trends. The combined ratio ended 2022 at 
95.6%, versus 94.5% in 2021; the underlying 
combined ratio deteriorated to 92.0% in 2022 
from 90.3% in 2021. Q2 underwriting results 
deteriorated on higher weather claims, but 
underlying results were profitable, evidenced by 
the underlying combined ratio of 91.1% versus 
92.8%. 
uWe forecast operating EPS of $12.24 in 2023, 
rising to $16.95 in 2024 and to $19.25 in 2025. 
Per-share results have been helped by share 
buybacks, including $2.1 billion in 2022.","Investment Rationale/Risk
uOur opinion on the shares is Buy. We raised our 
view from Hold after Q1 results indicated TRV’s 
top-line results were accelerating, including the 
15% rise in Q1 Business Insurance written 
premiums. We believe an uptick in premium 
growth, coupled with stable to improving 
underlying claim trends, provide the shares with 
a catalyst to close their valuation discount to 
peers and historical averages. We view TRV as a 
prudent underwriter with an above-average 
quality balance sheet. Our view is tempered by 
TRV’s exposure to certain “long tail” risks, 
although TRV has prudently managed these 
risks, in our view.
uRisks to our recommendation and target price 
include a deterioration in asbestos and 
environmental claims as well as reserve 
development, erosion in underwriting trends, a 
surge in catastrophe losses, or erosion in the 
credit quality of the investment portfolio.
uOur 12-month target price of $205 assumes a 
multiple of 12.1x our 2024 operating EPS 
estimate and 10.6x our 2025 operating EPS 
estimate. Our target multiple reflects our view 
that TRV shares will trade in line with its three-
year average forward multiple of 12.8x (on 
decent top-line growth trends) and compared 
to the peer average of 13.1x.","Industry Outlook
CFRA’s fundamental outlook for the property & 
casualty insurance sub-industry is positive. 
Despite some persistent claim cost inflation and 
some uncertainty over the level of claims 
stemming from the myriad of recent catastrophes,  
industry profitability in most lines of coverage is 
set to improve in 2023 amid an expected easing of 
heavy worldwide catastrophe claims that plagued 
most insurers in recent years. However, these 
losses will likely extract enough excess 
underwriting capacity from the insurance 
marketplace to cause rates for many lines of 
coverage to remain firm. The degree to which 
demand decreases for certain types of insurance 
products, particularly those in the commercial 
lines area, will depend on the health of the broader 
economy in the U.S. and overseas and the degree 
to which they are able to withstand a rise in 
interest rates. Underwriting results in the core 
personal auto and homeowners’  line will likely 
remain unprofitable in 2023, as persistently high 
claims inflation (caused in part by supply chain 
issues) could hamper further margin gains, 
particularly among personal lines auto insurers.   
A firming of rates (particularly in the commercial 
lines segment) will likely propel net written 
premiums by about 7%-10% in 2023 and by 6%-
10% in 2024, in our estimation. This compares 
with the 8.3% rise in net written premiums 
reported in 2022 (in line with our 7%-10% growth 
forecast), and the 8% rise  posted in 2021.  
Operating profitability in the property-casualty 
industry is heavily influenced by the level of 
weather and catastrophe losses. Worldwide 
catastrophe losses totaled about $270 billion in 
2022, down slightly from $280 billion in 2021 and 
below the record of about $350 billion set in 2017. 
Insured losses were around $120 billion in 2022, 
or about 44% of total losses, above a long-term 
average we estimate to be around 40%, but below 
the 51% of catastrophe losses that were covered 
by insurance in 2018, reflecting a shift in the type 
of catastrophes, as fires (which are more 
comprehensively covered by insurance) accounted 
for more of the catastrophes in 2018, while hurricanes (whose flooding is typically 
excluded from insurance coverage) typically 
account for the majority of catastrophes.  
Following the rise in catastrophe losses and an 
uptick in claims costs in several core line of 
coverage (including personal auto), 
underwriting results deteriorated in 2022. As a 
result, the combined (loss and expense) ratio—
a key underwriting metric—deteriorated in 
2022 to 102.7% from 99.6% in 2021, 98.8% in 
2020, and 99.0% in 2019.   
As of March 31, 2023 (latest available), the 
industry had $1 trillion in policyholder surplus 
(or capital), supporting its written premium 
base of about $782 billion. The industry was 
leveraging its capital at less than a 1:1 ratio. 
Assuming a historical (and somewhat 
theoretical) benchmark 2:1 leverage of capital, 
we estimate the industry had “excess” capital 
of over $300 billion. We think this “excess” 
capital (or underwriting capacity) has enabled 
insurers to leverage the firmer pricing 
environment and grow their book of business—
a trend that may continue as demand and 
pricing remain firm.
During 2022, the S&P Property & Casualty 
Insurance Index rose by 12.6%, while the S&P 
1500 Index declined by 19.1%. Year-to-date 
through August 11,  2023, the S&P Property & 
Casualty Insurance Index declined by 3.5%,

Our 12-month fundamental investment outlook 
for the industrial machinery sub-industry is 
neutral, reflecting our outlook for moderating 
order growth as shipments and lead times 
improve, balanced by resiliency across a number 
of key end markets. In our view,  drivers of 
machinery demand will be the ramping of 
aerospace and defense production lines, and 
strength in domestic oil and gas drilling activity. 
We expect these positive demand drivers to be 
offset by a softening manufacturing sector amid 
broader macro uncertainty.
The U.S. manufacturing sector remains in 
contraction territory following 28 months of 
growth, driven in part by moderating new order 
rates. Despite the recent softening of demand 
within the manufacturing sector, industrial 
machinery backlogs remain well-above historical 
levels (July U.S. Census Release: up 1% Y/Y; up 
35% from February 2020). Several of the largest 
players within the sub-industry, including Parker-
Hannifin, Otis,  Ingersoll Rand, and Xylem, achieved 
sequential growth to already elevated backlogs 
during Q2. We anticipate backlogs being worked 
down as the year progresses on meaningful 
improvements in global supply chains and 
component availability. We see near-record 
backlogs providing a cushion amid a dynamic 
macro environment and supporting financial 
results over the coming quarters.
The U.S.’s large aerospace and defense 
manufacturing base is a key customer for the 
industrial machinery sub-industry, and we see 
these customers supporting order growth 
throughout 2023. Looking ahead, defense 
spending will likely be boosted in response to 
Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, while at the same time, 
U.S. air travel demand has been robust. These 
factors are pushing Boeing, Airbus, and the major 
U.S. defense firms to ramp up production lines, 
which, in turn, should lead to healthy order growth 
for the industrial machinery sub-industry out of 
this customer group.
Machinery demand is also being supported by oil 
and gas companies. As of September 1,  2023 (per Baker Hughes), global oil and gas drilling 
activity was up 3% Y/Y, reflecting increasing 
global energy demand and supportive oil and 
gas prices. We expect activity surrounding oil 
and gas drilling and refining to be relatively 
solid through 2023 as prices remain favorable. 
Both upstream and downstream oil and gas 
players rely on many types of machinery, and 
higher production volumes could be a tailwind 
for the industrial machinery sub-industry over 
the next year if demand remains resilient and 
prices stay elevated.
We believe easing inflationary pressures from 
energy and material costs could support 
bottom line expansion in 2023. In July 2023, 
the producer price index for electric power in 
the U.S. was down 40% Y/Y. The index for 
global metal prices was up 4% Y/Y but down 
23% from the 2022 peak. Easing cost inflation 
should lend to machinery customer profitability 
and support new equipment orders, though we 
see an uncertain macro backdrop being a 
limiting factor.
Year-to-date through August 31, the S&P 1500 
Industrial Machinery Index rose 20.2%, 
outperforming the S&P 1500 Industrials Index 
(+13.1%) and the S&P 1500 Index (+17.9%).
