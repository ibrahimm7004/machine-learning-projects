The fall in earnings was mainly caused by Ocean (-76% Y/ Y; -33% Q/Q) on reduced freight rates (-51% Y/ Y; -15% Q/Q) and weaker volumes (-6% Y/Y; +7% Q/Q). uMaersk lifted the bottom end of its 2023 EBITDA guidance to USD9.5-USD11.0 billion from USD8.0-11.0 billion reflecting the stronger H1 2023 results but lowered its 2023 market volume outlook to -4.0% to -1.0% (previously - 2.5% to +0.5%) on continued inventory correction till the end of 2023. We think the implied sequential drop in H1 2023 earnings reflects the ongoing decline in Maerskâ€™s contracted rate given that they are being reset to a level nearer to the spot which has fallen sharply since mid-2022. Also, we gathered that the industryâ€™s supply of new vessels may increase freight capacity by 9% and 10% in 2023 and 2024 respectively, which we think will outgrow demand causing overcapacity and further deterioration in freight rates. uWe forecast EPS of USD220 for 2023 and USD100 for 2024 as we expect a further weakness in freight rates.\"\"\""

       "['Highlights\\nuMarks & Spencer (MKS) released a trading \\nupdate covering the first 19 weeks of FY24 \\n(Mar.) up to August 12. MKS saw continued \\nmarket share growth in both Clothing & Home \\nand Food. Like-for-Like (LFL) sales growth \\ncame in as a positive to us, up 11% LFL and 6% \\nLFL for Clothing & Home, and Food, respectively. \\nRecall that in its FY23 results, MKS reported \\nsales growth of 9.9%, driven by Clothing & \\nHome (+11.5%), Food (+8.7%), and \\nInternational (+12.6%). The sustained growth \\nmomentum reflects MKS’ attractive value \\nproposition amid continued price investment, in \\nour view. \\nuAs part of its mid-term objectives, MKS targets \\nadjusted operating martin (AOM) to c.4% and \\nc.10% for Food, and Home & Clothing, \\nrespectively. Recall that FY23 AOM at 5.2% is \\nbehind FY22 at 6.5% as muted pricing activity \\nwas insufficient to offset sourcing and freight \\ncosts. In its trading update, MKS indicated \\n“significant improvement against previous \\nexpectations (moderate revenue growth)”, \\nwhich we attribute to the group’s positive \\nprogress towards its strategy, and relatively \\nrobust retail consumer spending. \\nuWe raise our FY24 EPS to GBP0.20 (from \\nGBP0.16) and FY25 to GBP0.23 (from GBP0.19).',\n",
       " 'Highlights\\nuWe forecast Philips’ (PHIA) sales to grow by ~3% \\nin 2023, mainly driven by its biggest segment, \\nDiagnostic & Treatment (D&T). In Q2 2023, \\ncomparable sales grew 9% Y/Y, driven by all \\nsegments with D&T growing 12% on continued \\nsupply chain improvement while Personal \\nHealth segment returned to growth (improving \\nsellout trends, although consumer demand \\nremains subdued). PHIA raised its 2023 \\ncomparable sales growth outlook in July 2023 \\n(following the Q2 result) to mid-single digit \\nfrom low-single digit.\\nuWe forecast adjusted EBITA margin to improve \\nto ~9% for 2023 from 7.4% in 2022, with the \\noverall inflationary headwind being cushioned by \\nproductivity measures, largely in line with the \\nguidance of at the upper end of the high-single-\\ndigit range. Adjusted EBITA margin expanded \\n4.9%-pts in Q2 2023 (H1: +3.7%-pts to 9.4%) \\nas productivity and pricing mitigate the cost \\nheadwinds. According to PHIA, productivity \\nmeasures (including reducing workforce – \\nreduction of 6,600 roles as of H1 2023) \\ndelivered a total of EUR427 million in savings in \\nH1 2023.\\nuWe forecast EPS to improve to EUR1.16 for \\n2023 and EUR1.30 for 2024 on better sales and \\nmargin.',\n",
       " 'Highlights\\nuFollowing a 9.3% decline in operating revenues \\nin 2022 (versus our forecast of a 2% to 4% \\ndrop), we expect revenues to rise by 6% to 9% \\nin 2023 and by 7% to 10% in 2024, reflecting \\nour expectation of a modest recovery in asset \\nvalues and wider spreads on the rise in interest \\nrates. Our forecast excludes investment and \\nderivative gains and/or losses, which can be \\nsignificant. Operating revenue weakness in \\n2022  primarily reflected 11% lower fee \\nrevenues, a 14% drop in investment income, \\nand a 9% decline in investment management \\nfees, partly offset by 3.5% higher premiums.\\nuWe expect revenues at 65%-owned \\nAllianceBernstein (AB 30 ****) will be flat to up \\n6% in 2023 and will rise by 4% to 7% in 2024, \\nversus the 8% drop reported in 2022. AB’s \\nassets under management (AUM) of $691.5 \\nbillion at  June 30, 2023 rose 7% from $646.4 \\nbillion at December 31, 2022. AB’s fund flow \\ntrends turned positive in Q1, with inflows of \\n$800 million, but eroded in Q2 with $4B of \\noutflows. During 2022, net outflows of $3.6 \\nbillion contrasted with net inflows of $26.1 \\nbillion in 2021.\\nuWe forecast operating EPS of $4.95 in 2023, \\nrising to $6.40 in 2024, and to $7.05 in 2025, \\nversus  operating EPS of $5.08 reported in 2022.',\n",
       " 'Highlights\\nuQ2 sales fell 14% Y/Y on volume declines in \\nTitanium Technologies and the Advanced \\nPerformance Materials portfolio, partially offset \\nby pricing gains. Volume declines were 27% in \\nTT, 1% in Thermal & Specialized Solutions, and \\n9% in APM. We believe CC will see sales declines \\nof 6% in 2023 and 3% in 2024 given its large \\npresence in the manufacturing of harmful \\nchemicals in most of its segments. \\nuIts TSS segment has a leading position in the \\nfluorochemicals market and its APM segment \\nproduces products containing PFAS and Gen-X \\n(previously known as C8), all of which are highly \\ntoxic and have been linked to certain cancers. \\nWe believe possible regulatory pressure may \\neliminate or restrict CC’s ability to produce \\nproducts containing these chemicals.\\nu Q2 EBIT margin declined Y/Y on lower volumes \\nand higher input/raw material costs, partially \\noffset by strong pricing. We think EBIT margin \\nwill contract in 2023 with high raw material \\nprices, such as chlorine. Also, with  lower \\nforecasted volumes and days sales inventory \\n(DSI) rising to 107 days in Q2 2023 from 78 \\ndays in Q2 2022, we believe margins will be \\nunder significant pressure. We estimate 2023 \\nand 2024 EBIT margin to contract 225 bps and  \\n100 bps.',\n",
       " 'Highlights\\nuIn 2023, we expect revenue growth of about \\n$53.2 billion, a decrease of 8.4% Y/Y, as the \\nanticipated decline in Humira sales is partially \\noffset by fast-growing immunology drugs \\nSkyrizi and Rinvoq. The 2020 acquisition of the \\nformer Allergan also brought in significant \\ngrowth contributors in medical aesthetics and \\nneuroscience areas. These latter areas \\ncontributed almost $12 billion in revenues in \\n2022. \\nuABBV’s revenues have historically been largely \\ntied to sales of its blockbuster drug, Humira, \\nwhich began to experience biosimilar \\ncompetition outside of the U.S. (OUS) in October \\n2018.
